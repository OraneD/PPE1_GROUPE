    <span class=date>1929:</span> The interjection “nerts”, possibly used because
    some consider it vulgar to blurt out “nuts”, comes into use and enjoys some
    popularity.

    </p><p>

    <span class=date>1938:</span> Ventriloquist Edgar Bergen (father of Candice) debuts
    a new dummy named Mortimer Snerd, which he plays as a slow-talking rural rube.

    </p><p>

    <span class=date>1940s:</span> The singular “nert” evolves into a label applied
    to people, meaning someone who is nutty.&ensp;Its use is not widespread, but
    has been attested among particular groups, one being surfers.

    </p><p class=lastp>

    <span class=date>1950:</span> Dr. Seuss tosses off the nonsense word
    “nerd” as the name of an imaginary animal in <em>If I Ran The Zoo</em>.<br/>

    <p class=firstp>

    <span class=date>1951:</span> Teen slang in the Detroit area is reported to
    have adopted “nerd” as the fashionable new term for an uncool unhip person,
    otherwise known as a “drip” or “square”.&ensp;This usage may or may not
    predate Dr. Seuss’s, and may or may not derive from “nert” or “Snerd”, but
    it definitely spread from southeast Michigan.

    </p><p>

    <span class=date>1960:</span> The spelling “nurd” comes into use, and
    predominates for some time.&ensp;It spreads widely among many of the younger
    generation, from hot-rodders to Yale students, but remains relatively little
    known to most of the public.

    </p><p>

    <span class=date>1965:</span> The word is by now somewhat commonly connected
    with bookish intellectual types.&ensp;At MIT the spelling “gnurd”
    catches on.&ensp;At this time, brainiacs at MIT and similar institutions are
    known for backward clothing styles and outmoded crewcuts.&ensp;Many of them
    enjoy trashy science fiction.<br/>

    <span class="illabl" style="width: 13em">Steve “Slug” Russell,
    creator of the first video game, at MIT</span>
    <!-- Technically, there was at least one video game which predated Spacewar,
    namely William Higginbotham’s “Tennis for Two”.  But this was implemented
    with analog circuitry connected to an oscilloscope, and was a pretty thin
    sketch of a game.  Spacewar (which was started by Russell and elaborated by
    many others) was the first piece of computer software to implement a game
    which could only be played by interacting with a realtime video display, and
    which furthermore developed into a fully realized game rather than just a
    proof of concept.  Early on-screen representations of tictactoe or checkers
    do not count as video games. -->

    </p><p>

    <span class=date>1968:</span> The “Save Star Trek” movement becomes the
    first instance of successful mass activism to promote an agenda favorable to
    nerds.&ensp;The event fosters a lasting tendency for nerd culture to treat
    fandom as something to be proselytized.<br/>

    <span class="illabl" style="width: 14em">Bjo Trimble (left), “the woman
    who saved Star Trek”</span>

    </p><p>

    <i>circa</i> <span class=date>1972:</span> I hear the word for the first time
    when my dad (himself a high IQ pocket-protected engineer who had only recently
    ceased rocking a crewcut) declares Batman to be a nerd.&ensp;It briefly becomes
    my little brother’s favorite new word.

    </p><p class=lastp>

    <span class=date>1974:</span> ABC debuts <em>Happy Days</em>, which is set in the
    1950s, and popularizes the term by using it as a piece of period slang.&ensp;They
    usually apply it not to smart or socially awkward characters, but to those who try
    to be cool and fail.&ensp;Usage of the word among viewers skyrockets.

    <p class=firstp>

    <span class=date>1975:</span> As the first home microcomputers are announced,
    National Lampoon issues this poster, firmly establishing the stereotype for what
    the word will now mean.<br/>
    <img src="img/lampoonurd.jpg"
         class=illo style="height: 600px;" />

    </p><p>

    <span class=date>1977:</span> In this watershed year, personal computers reach
    the mass market, which results in raising the visibility of computer and
    electronics experts as a recognizable social class, and over several years,
    accelerating the association of the word with them in particular.&ensp;At the
    same time, <em>Star Wars</em> brings science fiction fandom into mainstream
    visibility, and a “New Wave” sound starts to emerge in rock&amp;roll, coming
    from bands that are often overtly nerdy, in stark contrast to the previously
    popular “cock rock” style.
    <!-- Fun fact:  Seymour Stein of Sire Records says he coined the term New
         Wave mainly to avoid describing the Talking Heads as Punk. -->
    </p><p>

    <span class=date>1981:</span> By now several computer innovators have achieved
    wealth and become household names, thereby becoming role models and getting
    people to start thinking of nerds as winners.&ensp;This trend will expand
    steadily for the rest of the century.&ensp;New Wave rock moves into the
    mainstream, making stars of nerds like David Byrne and Thomas Dolby.

    </p><p>

    <span class=date>1984:</span> The movie <em>Revenge Of The Nerds</em> is
    released.&ensp;Some people with technical interests and skills immediately
    start to use the word as self-description, with a “nerd pride” movement
    becoming visible a few years later.

    </p><p>

    <span class=date>1993:</span> As nerd pride becomes fairly well established,
    and the mainstream connotation of the word slowly shifts from disdain to
    respect, Professor Gerald Sussman, a former MIT hacker, tells a reporter “I
    want every child to become a nerd.”&ensp;(It’s around this time that one of
    my nerd friends took to proclaiming “It’s our world now and you can’t have
    it back!”)<br/>

         class=illo style="height: 150px;" />

    </p><p>

    <span class=date>1995:</span> The World Wide Web popularizes mass usage of
    computer networks.&ensp;Non-experts start creating websites in large
    numbers, and produce the beginnings of today&rsquo;s distinct internet
    culture.&ensp;In this environment, minor subcultures become highly visible,
    and the terms “nerd” and “geek” are increasingly used for those seen
    devoting excessive time and energy to fandoms, similarly to how the word
    “otaku” is used in Japan &mdash; a term which anime fandom is bringing to
    America around this time.

    </p><p>

    <span class=date>1996:</span> The term “Geek Chic” appears, as high-fashion
    designers start to ape nerdy clothing styles for both sexes — even “flood”
    pants.&ensp;Also, aintitcoolnews.com appears, and proves so influential that
    the entertainment industry soon begins recognizing nerd fans as both a
    powerful and well-organized interest group, and a lucrative audience demographic.

    </p><p class=lastp>

    <span class=date>2000:</span> The bursting of the dot-com stock bubble
    marks an  endpoint to the “computer revolution” — it’s now just big
    business, not the definition of success and coolness.&ensp;This removes
    some of the excessive glamor that has built up around nerds.

    <span class=date>2003:</span> San Diego Comic-Con grows with extreme rapidity,
    becoming the center of the various fandoms associated with nerds.&ensp;The public
    becomes steadily more aware of the breadth of “nerd culture”.&ensp;It becomes
    common for people to describe themselves as nerds or geeks based on their fandoms
    rather than on their skills or temperament — that is, they label themselves as
    such based on what they consume rather than what they produce, even as these
    fandoms increasingly merge into the mainstream.&ensp;Opinion pieces bemoaning
    mass nerdification start cropping up, mainly in conservative media.<br/>

    <span class=date>2007:</span> CBS debuts <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>, bringing
    the first broad depiction of all facets of nerd culture to a mass audience.

    </p><p>

    <span class=date>2009:</span> As the word “geek” increasingly pushes aside the
    word “nerd”, some nerd produces this handy diagram for defining the difference
    between them:<br/>

    </p><p>

    <span class=date>2012:</span> As supposedly nerdy interests such as superheroes
    and wizards take over pop culture, jock types also move into technical
    fields.&ensp;“<a href="http://www.theneweconomy.com/technology/silicons-sexist-brogrammer-culture-is-locking-women-out-of-tech">Brogrammers</a>”
    are now a thing.

    </p><p class=lastp>

    <span class=date>2013:</span> <a href="http://moviebob.blogspot.com/">“Movie Bob”
    Chipman</a> sums up where we’ve arrived by observing that calling oneself a nerd
    has now become merely a “commodified lifestyle label”, saying nothing about your
    temperament or skills or social history.&ensp;He also notes that today’s gamers
    and comic geeks have become as prone to bullying as their jock predecessors were.

    </p><p>

    <span class=date>2016:</span> Director Paul Feig makes a <i>Ghostbusters</i> sequel
    with a new all-female team.&ensp;The backlash from an offended minority eventually
    drives him to say, “Geek culture is home to some of the biggest assholes I’ve ever
    met in my life.”&ensp;Meanwhile, in the fashion world, “geek chic” is more popular,
    and more literal, than ever.<br/>

“nerds” anymore... where I now see it flourishing best is among the crowd known
as MAKERS.
