Jodrell Bank, Cheshire

   This is more than just the backdrop to the BBC’s Stargazing Live,
   Jodrell Bank is home to the Lovell Telescope and is a centre for
   world-class science. This is ground zero for a project linking six
   other UK-based radio telescopes into a dish array spanning 134 miles
   and is headquarters for the €1.5bn Square Kilometre Array, comprising
   thousands of radio receptors across Australia and eight countries in
   southern Africa. Bernard Lovell started radio astronomy here in the
   1940s, using a collection of army surplus radar kit he hauled out to
   the gardens of the University of Manchester. More than 60 years on, his
   name-scape remains the world’s third-biggest moveable telescope, a
   combination of 3,200 tonnes of metal and railway bogey.
   Adult £6.30, child £4.50, family ticket from £20. Open daily 10am-5pm,
   jodrellbank.net

Air Radar Defence Museum, Norfolk

   Control desk and panels at Air Radar Defence Museum, Norfolk

   The Air Radar Defence Museum occupies the site of the world’s longest,
   continuously operating radar installation. RAF Neatishead was a key
   link in the radar chain deployed successfully against the Luftwaffe
   during the second world war and scanned the waves for incoming attacks.
   It’s possible to poke at the same equipment RAF operators used to
   detect hostile blips building three-dimensional scans using left and
   right controls and view, in real-time, the maelstrom that is civilian
   air space over the UK today. There’s other technical gear here, too: a
   section of one of those radar golf ball shields, beautifully intricate
   electronic valves, the cockpit of a Jaguar ground-attack aircraft, and
   a disarmed Bristol Bloodhound surface-to-air missile.
   Adult £10, child £5, family ticket £25. Open Tues, Thurs and bank
   holiday Mondays, April to November and the second Saturday of each
   month, 10am-5pm, radarmuseum.co.uk

The National Museum of Computing, Milton Keynes

   The National Museum of Computing History keeps the bits and bytes of
   old computers alive while celebrating those no longer with us. It
   houses some of the world’s oldest, rarest and best-remembered systems:
   rooms of BBC Micros, a NeXT – created by Steve Jobs and used by Tim
   Berners-Lee to “invent” the web; a 2.5-tonne calculator called the
   Harwell Dekatron, which is the world’s oldest working digital computer
   following four years of renovation. This was also part of Bletchley
   Park, where mathematicians, engineers and the military worked to crack
   encrypted messages during the second world war. And you can see a
   replica of Colossus, the room-size machine used to break the cyphers.
   Adult £7.50, concessions £5, family ticket £20. Collosus Galleries open
   daily from 10.30am-5pm; full museum open Thurs, Sat and Sun from
   12pm-5pm, tnmoc.org

Kelvedon Hatch Secret Nuclear Bunker, Essex

   Photograph: Ed Moore

   Walls of concrete 3.5m-thick, and reinforced using tungsten rods set on
   shock absorbers and resting on a 60m bed of gravel all topped by … a
   bungalow – yes, welcome to Kelvedon Hatch, an absurdist chapter in the
   UK’s cold war story. Kelvedon was an early warning system built,
   rapidly, under the Rotor programme, following Russia’s successful test
   of a nuclear bomb and deployment of heavy bomber aircraft capable of
   reaching the UK during the early 1950s. Kelvedon was a network of
   bunkers into which hundreds of government and military personnel were
   to have retreated following a nuclear attack, in order to keep running
   Britain. The place is, by turns, frightening, impressive and saddening:
   testimony to a disappeared stiff-upper-lip world; there are
   communications rooms that contain telexes and red telephones, desks
   dedicated to government departments, even a suite for the BBC to keep
   broadcasting to those above ground.
   Adult £7, child £5, family ticket £16.50. Open, March-October, daily
   10am-5pm; November-February open Thurs-Sun 10am-4pm,
   secretnuclearbunker.com

Crossness Pumping Station, London

   At Crossness you’ll find the Victorian development that helped
   transform London into a modern city. It is an interconnected system
   involving a six-acre reservoir capable of holding 27 million gallons,
   sewers and massive pumps that stopped the river Thames being a
   stinking, open cesspit. Crossness was the work of civil engineer Joseph
   Bazalgette and his creation bursts with civic Victorian pride: a visit
   to the massive engines at Crossness reveals a hall that’s more church
   then engine room, boasting ironwork of such intricacy and painted
   detail that you soon forget this was a sewage plant.
   Adult £8, child £2. Open Tues and Fri 9.30-4pm and on the second Sunday
   of the month 9.30am-4pm; see website for exact dates and details,
   crossness.org.uk

Cruachan Power Station, Argyll and Bute

   Cruachan Power Station, Argyll and Bute
   Photograph: Bill Ray

   The Cruachan hydroelectric power station was the world’s first
   reversible-turbine power station – and it was built into a mountain.
   Everything about Cruachan is epic: surveyed in 1921, construction only
   began in 1959 and took two years thanks to poor weather and the remote
   location. The loch that feeds Cruachan didn’t exist before 1959, it’s
   manmade and dammed using 200,000 tonnes of concrete. The loch’s waters
   flow into an aqueduct and tunnels feeding down into a cavernous machine
   room housing four turbines. This facility was blasted and mined by more
   than 1,300 workers housed locally and known as the Tunnel Tigers.
   Health and safety? Thirty-six died digging out the cavern, tunnels and
   aqueducts and are commemorated in a carved tribute.
   Visitor centre free, guided tours adult £7, child £2.50. April-October
   open daily 9.30am-4.45pm; November-March open Mon-Fri 10am-3.45pm,
   visitcruachan.co.uk

Hursley Park, Hampshire

   IBM bought the 16th-century Hursley House in the 1950s as postwar
   global demand for computers increased. IBM’s answer to this was the
   mainframe. One of 43 IBM innovation centres, Hursley has been
   instrumental in the development of the company’s most important
   software, as well as advancements in displays and disk-based storage.
   Hursley is home to IBM’s CICS MQ Series software that – in many cases –
   runs transactions on the mainframe system that underpins your retail
   bank, and ensures you can withdraw cash from you account via an ATM.
   Museum not open to the public but group visits can be arranged,

The Lizard Wireless Station, Marconi Centre and Wireless Field, Cornwall

   Cornwall

   This part of the UK was a hub in the communications revolution.
   Guglielmo Marconi didn’t invent wireless but, working here at the dawn
   of the 20th century, he unlocked its potential. Before he moved on to
   Canada, Marconi worked in a shed near the Lizard village and then in a
   purpose-built facility at Poldhu. That shed survives as a Grade
   II-listed building, overseen by the National Trust. Poldhu Cove, from
   where Marconi generated a signal powerful enough to reach North America
   for the first time, is gone – but a set of foundations and ruins marks
   its spot. From these ruins has sprung the Marconi Centre museum that is
   home to radio rooms used by the Poldhu Amateur Radio Club and open to
   visiting licensed operators.
   Suggested donation £1pp. 22 March-30 October open Tues, Thurs and Fri
   noon-3pm, lizardwireless.org

James Clerk Maxwell House and Foundation, Edinburgh

   James Clerk Maxwell House and Foundation, Edinburgh
   Photograph: Bill Ray

   James Clerk Maxwell is essential to physics as we understand it today.
   Maxwell posited the existence of radio waves laying the foundation of
   wireless decades later; proved pictures shot through different colour
   filters could be combined to create a single colour image, setting in
   stone the concept of RGB (red, green and blue); and proved
   mathematically that the rings of Saturn could be made of neither solid
   nor liquid but were comprised of rocks. All that, and Maxwell was a
   poet. Number 14 India Street in Edinburgh was Maxwell’s birthplace and
   you can tour this slice of early 19th-century Georgiana – built as
   Britain turned from thoughts of war and how to defeat Napoleon
   Bonaparte to breaking the frontiers of science.
   Open by appointment, tours usually available Mon-Fri 10am-12pm and
   2.30pm-5pm, clerkmaxwellfoundation.org

Spaceguard Centre, Powys

   Spaceguard Centre, Powys

   Spaceguard is the inspiration of one man: Jonathan Tate. It is part of
   a global effort to track Near Earth Objects (NEOs): 100-150 tonnes of
   material hits the Earth’s atmosphere every day, most of it harmless
   dust, but some have had bigger impacts: the 2013 meteorite over
   Chelyabinsk that injured 1,600, the 1908 Tunguska event in Siberia that
   levelled hundreds of square miles of forest. Spaceguard houses two
   large, robotically controlled telescopes, used by Tate to confirm other
   people’s NEO spots. A tour of this one-man outpost high in Powys, with
   Tate, takes in telescopes, fragments – including bits from Chelyabinsk
   – and enough data to ensure it won’t just be the younger members of
   your party who leave wide eyed.
   Adult £7, child £4. Tours operate May-Sept, Wed-Sun at 10.30am, 2pm and
   4pm; Oct-Apr at 2pm and 4pm, spaceguardcentre.com

   While campaigners in Sweden are petitioning to change the definition of
   ‘nerd’ from ʼsimple-minded and laughable personʼ to something more
   positive, a question arises - have the words ‘nerd’ and ‘ GEEK ’ lost
   their derogatory connotations?

   When we say ‘ GEEK ’ these days, we tend to think of Mark Zuckerberg,
   Bill Gates and Steve Jobs – people who have made billions with their
   high-tech miracles, and are greatly admired by many.

   Referring to some celebrities as GEEK nowadays is a frequent
   occurrence, while GEEK-themed books are on must-read lists.

   Even Chris Kluwe, who has been voted the “sexiest man of the year”, has
   publicly identified himself as a ‘nerd’.

We wanted to know how Labs participants defined the term ‘ GEEK ’, and whether
they thought being a ‘ GEEK ’ has become cool.

Here’s what we found…

   The responses of our Labs participants showed that there is definitely
   a shift in societal attitudes towards ‘geekiness’, as most participants
   gladly identified themselves as ‘ GEEK ’.

   Those who identified themselves as GEEK defined being a ‘ GEEK ’ as
   being technology-savvy, academic, actively using social media and
   modern, which are evidently not negative connotations.

   However, some participants did not identify themselves as GEEK, and
   defined a ‘ GEEK ’ as someone who spends all of his/her time in front of
   a computer and ‘speaks, breaths and lives’ for technology.

Has it become ‘cool’ to be a GEEK?

   We also asked participants whether they think it has become cool to be
   a ‘ GEEK ’.

Most thought that is has become ‘cool’ to be a GEEK.

   A number of reasons were given, one of them being that ‘geeky’
   interests changed from academia to more widely acceptable subjects such
   as gaming.

   Others added that people are realising that by doing well at school
   they are increasing their chances of getting better paid jobs.

A parallel was drawn between being a ‘ GEEK ’ and being successful.

   Participants said that people such as Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs as
   role models for younger generation.

However, some participants did not think it has become ‘cool’ to be a GEEK,
saying that people who could be considered ‘ GEEK ’ are still ridiculed for
their niche interests.

   Some participants mentioned that it has become a trend many follow, but
   that it is not ‘cool to be someone you are not’. Plus, others thought
   that to dress like a GEEK has become cool, while to actually be a
   ‘ GEEK ’ hasn’t.

Participants who identified themselves as GEEK

     * Interestingly, most Labs participants identified themselves as
       GEEK. Their definitions of a ‘ GEEK ’ mentioned niche interests,
       knowledge of technology and social media, as well as not following
       mainstream trends and interests.

   “I am one. I played DnD at school, I larped, and I know how to filk. I
   was an early adopter of computers and electronic communications
   (usenet, BBS, etc) way before the media started talking about the world
   wide web. I am a nerd dyed in the wool” Dee D, Yorkshire

   “Iʼve always been quiet and interested in academia and I have a
   detailed interest in specific subjects” Anon

   “Because I enjoy going into the depths of analysing movies and films; I
   also know a little too much about Doctor Who” Anon

   “I like niche things and some things that are traditionally considered
   geeky and I often value these things over social life. I read, use
   social media, like technology and "geeky" stuff like sci-fi, genre
   fiction, fantasy and more” Anon, London

   “I have quite specific interests, some of which arenʼt really
   appreciated in popular culture” Anon

   “I am fascinated with a particular area of interest, beyond that of the
   ʼman in the streetʼ. Such interest can focus on the trivial rather than
   the important” Anon

   “I like niche things and some things that are traditionally considered
   geeky and I often value these things over social life. I read, use
   social media, like technology and "geeky" stuff like sci-fi, genre
   fiction, fantasy and more” London

   “Persons interested in science and technology, comics, anime, gaming.
   GEEK are people who have an interest in ʼfringeʼ topics but have
   better social skills and can be modern and cool” Anon

Participants who did not identify themselves as GEEK

     * Many participants who did not identify themselves as GEEK defined
       GEEK as very technology-focused.

   “Somebody who spends all there time on computers. I work with them
   (have done since 1978) but I go home and go out to do some gardening to
   get away from the dammed things. Speaks, breaths and lives for
   technology without looking at the other wonderful things the world has
   to offer” Ian H, Warlingham
     * Some believed that being a GEEK has become a trend and a fashion
       statement more than a lifestyle, and is more mainstream these days
       than standing out from the crowd.

   “The meaning has become blurred. It has become trendy and fashionable
   to be a GEEK so more people think they identify as one. It is
   especially frustrating to see so many people wearing those large fake
   glasses - stop it now!” Nigel, Holmfirth
     * Other participants associated being a GEEK with being good at maths
       and science.

   “I do not have the skills or mathematical knowledge to consider myself
   a GEEK or nerd. Wish I did though” Anon

   “Iʼm not cool, but both of those I associate with people into maths or
   science, which Iʼm awful at” Anon

Participants who thought that being a ‘ GEEK ’ has become cool

   “The usual interests of GEEK has changed from academic to more widely
   acceptable pursuits like gaming” Anon

   “I like to hope that people are finally realising that being an idiot
   at school and gaining few qualifications is not cool. However it may
   just be my perception as my peers have changed greatly in the past few
   years to those who are much more educated” Katy, Glasgow

   “Rise of the internet - people who are able to use computers are now
   able to have very successful careers and earn a great deal. People like
   Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs have become "celebrity nerds" and are
   role models for the younger generation. I think that there is an
   idealised version of a nerd though; someone who is just quiet, not
   particularly sociable and studious is never going to be considered
   particularly cool. It depends on the definition of GEEK or nerd” Anon

   “To a certain extent itʼs become more mainstream so more people are
   doing it. Not everything "geeky" is now cool, but thereʼs a level of
   cultural acceptance and curiosity about things that has made it cooler”
   London

   “I was bullied all the way through school for being a GEEK … Now
   people need my skills and I earn more than those that put me down.
   Finally society might be starting to realise that what is important is
   dedication, skills and intellect and not physical strength or how many
   women you can sleep with” Anon
     * Some participants said that TV shows featuring ‘geeky’ characters
       have added to making being a ‘ GEEK ’ more mainstream.

   “The likes of Doctor Who and The Big Bang Theory have popularised
   geekiness with the general public” Alexander, Somerset

   “Programmes like the Big Bang Theory have popularised nerds, and the
   fact that computers have become more common place. Plus, some high
   flying nerds (Steve Jobs et al) have removed the stigma” Hove

Participants who said that being a ‘ GEEK ’ has not become ‘cool’

     * Some participants believed that it has not become cool to be a
       ‘ GEEK ’, as many people are still ‘ridiculed’ for niche interests.

   “People are still ridiculed if they donʼt share popular opinions,
   interests etc.” Anon
     * Some thought that there is a difference between what it’s like to
       be a ‘ GEEK ’ in reality, and in TV shows, as people who are
       introverted and have ‘nerdy interests’ are judged.

   “There is still a big difference between what TV and films would like
   us to think is a nerd and what a real one is. In real life there is
   still a lot of prejudice against people with nerdy interests and we
   still arenʼt very open about it. As real nerds are often introverted,
   we do still get some stick just because of that” Anon
     * Others believed that being a ‘ GEEK ’ has become a label, and many
       are only pretending to be one as it is a trend.

   “Itʼs became this label, and people are trying to fit to this label,
   while itʼs become popular, I would not call it cool to be something
   youʼre not” Calvin T, Huddersfield

   “I still think that the majority of people do not accept GEEK or nerds
   but think that GEEK-chicʼ is definitely becoming popular” Anon

   “It has become "cool" to dress in a particular way that is associated
   to the stereotypical image of a nerd or GEEK because this suggests you
   are wacky, and therefore (apparently) creative and spontaneous. It
   hasnʼt become cool to be a GEEK or a nerd; there are simply some young
   people who feel that it is cool to play up to an image of being wacky
   or weird and, presumably, the way to do this is to conform to a fashion
   trend” Liam

Do you identify yourself as a GEEK? Has it become ʼcoolʼ to be one?

Rise of the new GEEK: how the outsiders won

   From superhero movies to techy sitcoms to captains of industry, GEEK
   have been running the show for years. But now that 'GEEK chic' is in
   the dictionary, and Topshop is selling 'dork' T-shirts, what is the
   future for nerd culture?
   • The top 10 GEEK heroes, from Umberto Eco to Mary Berry

   Cheer up, Britain – the clever people have won at last. Just look
   around you. If you went to a music festival, visited the beach or left
   the house this summer you'll have seen incontrovertible evidence on
   T-shirts. They were everywhere, declaring the wearer to be a GEEK, NERD
   or DORK in that big fat confident slab-serif typeface that usually says
   you're talking to someone who proudly attends PENN or NYU. Topshop
   brought out the three designs last Christmas, contestant Jordan Lee
   Davies wore the GEEK shirt on The Voice in April, and they they were
   bootlegged quicker than you can say "gaga artpop torrentz". By spring
   they were unavoidable, seen on the chests of schoolkids, Ibiza ravers
   and TOWIE nitwits alike, worn by everyone apart from, well … GEEK,
   nerds and dorks.

   Because what self-respecting comics fan, mathlete, Whovian, physics
   wonk, gamer, twee indie kid, alphabetiser of Criterion Collection DVDs
   or collector of BNIB original Transformer toys (pre-1990) would ever
   wear such a thing? They're so mainstream. By rights, the people who
   bought Topshop's GEEK tops and their knock-off market equivalents ought
   to be blinging it up in Hollister, SuperDry and Jack Wills as the Good
   Lord intended. A friend told me that seeing these shirts everywhere was
   like being beaten up by someone wearing an anti-bullying wristband.
   Maybe the ouroboros of irony shirts is finally devouring its own tail.
   Or perhaps Reddit user KezzzMC of Warwickshire can put it more pithily:
   GEEK chic: the g-word is now cool

   "Those T-shirts piss me off," he rage-typed shortly after Davies's
   appearance on The Voice, "mainly because throughout school me and my
   friends were called GEEK, and now all the chavs that called us GEEK
   have decided it'd be a good idea to start wearing them."

   Charming prole-bashing aside, you have to feel for him a little. But
   the triumph of the Topshop nerd top as the Frankie Say T-shirt of 2013
   is just the latest phase in the geeking of our culture. It's a massive
   reversal from the pre-digital 80s and 90s when GEEK were friendless
   and marginal figures, ostracised in their Dungeons & Dragons groups,
   and their cousins in purgatory the nerds were so haplessly asocial that
   they became subjects of their own underdog movie Revenge of the Nerds –
   "it's time for the odd to get even!" – in 1984. (On points of
   etymology, there are differences between nerds and GEEK but you really
   shouldn't let them bother you. Apparently GEEK are collection-oriented
   and interested in the newest developments in their chosen micro-field,
   while nerds are achievement-oriented and "studiously intellectual". As
   for dorks, nobody cares about dorks.)

   So what turned things around? First the digital revolution elevated
   alpha nerds such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates to unprecedented power
   and influence. Then Hollywood rediscovered a rich stream of
   intellectual property and coincident nostalgia in GEEK touchstones Star
   Wars, Marvel Comics and JRR Tolkien at the turn of the century. Coding
   nerd Shawn Fanning overturned the music industry with Napster, a GEEK
   project extraordinaire. Celebs got in on the act, with R&B producers
   The Neptunes rebranding as N.E.R.D. and stars as unlikely as Justin
   Timberlake, David Beckham and Myleene Klass donning thick-rimmed specs
   in the mid-noughties. Sitcoms The IT Crowd and The Big Bang Theory set
   out to satirise a GEEK world that was becoming more visible and
   powerful – face it, can you fix your own PC? – but did so with a
   surprising measure of warmth, making unlikely heroes out of Reynham
   Industries' Moss and the poster boy for high-functioning OCD, Caltech
   theoretical physicist Sheldon Cooper PhD.

   Now the phrase "GEEK chic" has been introduced into the Oxford English
   Dictionary – a decade late, but who's counting? – and editors at the
   rival Collins Dictionary are now tracking the very meaning of the word
   "GEEK" itself. Apparently it's changing before our eyes. According to
   Collins' Ian Brookes a GEEK is no longer a "boring and unattractive
   social misfit" and readers are "increasingly encountering the word in
   contexts other than computing, and with increasingly positive
   connotations." And a survey by advertising agency Inferno indicates
   that the public finds intelligence and passionate engagement with a
   hobby four times as attractive in a person than good looks or dressing
   well. In your face, beautiful people! The name of Inferno's campaign?

   Now the high end of the culture defers to GEEK-priests such as Malcolm
   "Tipping Point" Gladwell, Steven "Freakanomics" Levitt and statistician
   Nate Silver, surely the world's only functioning sports psephologist.
   The kind of people we used to call public intellectuals now look like
   they play in a retro band. And the best rock bands, such as British Sea
   Power and Pathé newsreel samplers Public Service Broadcasting, are
   GEEK and proud, fuelled by wide-ranging obsessions including maritime
   history and birdwatching. Meanwhile, in our society's seedier reaches
   you will find wildly popular T-shirts featuring a succession of
   tired-looking Zoo and Nuts girls pouting in secretary glasses – because
   that's GEEK, yeah?

   What does it all mean? Has GEEK finally been absorbed and neutered, its
   network of rich and sustaining subcultures that were rooted in a real
   love of pop-culture minutiae and genuine expertise in matters technical
   now reduced to an unearned T-shirt and a pair of heavy-framed glasses
   with no lenses in them? Or has it, Borg-like, assimilated the
   mainstream and begun to subtly direct our world via its norms and
   memes? (Example: people actually know what memes are now.) Is GEEK just
   the post-noughties' fleeting equivalent of punk or lad culture, or does
   it mark a more fundamental realignment in our society? Above all, have
   we finally reached Peak GEEK?

   Chris Coleman is head of print and graphics at fashion trend
   forecasters WGSN. He puts the Rise of the Nerds in straightforward
   economic terms. If education, once free to all, is now scarce and
   expensive then you'll begin to unconsciously flaunt your commitment to
   the life of the mind. Thick glasses and a cardigan thus become the red
   braces and power-shoulders of the 21st century. Enticingly, you become
   both an outlaw and a member of an elite.

   Being a GEEK is a sign of education," he says. "The working environment
   has become so harsh that young people think that if they're going to
   succeed they'll have to do it for themselves. Though GEEK first
   appeared as a kind of anti-fashion statement, it's becoming bound up
   with entrepreneurialism, self-motivation and independence instead of
   weakness. Knowledge and craft and detail are cool again. It's about TED
   talks and Brian Cox – or even The Great British Bake Off – more than
   The X Factor. Someone calm and friendly but very knowledgeable like
   Mary Berry can be a GEEK hero too."

   Knowledge and craft, humility and enthusiasm … these are surprisingly
   conventional values. According to the prolific comics and TV writer,
   technology theorist and Wired magazine columnist Warren Ellis – who has
   scripted X-Men and Ultimate Fantastic Four as well as his own
   game-changing comics series The Authority and Transmetropolitan – the
   notion of GEEK culture itself is becoming outdated.

   "I find the term 'GEEK' weirdly disparaging and box-like for something
   that's so huge," he argues. "People will call Buffy the Vampire Slayer
   GEEK culture and yet it ran for seven years and is one of the most
   successful TV shows of all time. You could argue that superhero and
   fantasy movies are modern cinema. GEEK hasn't beaten the mainstream,
   it's the new iteration of the mainstream. You don't have to buy a
   fanzine on mail order to be part of it any more. You can be part of a
   digital community that draws you together and keeps building your
   interest."

   Meanwhile in GEEK's other fiefdom – technology – the old
   nerdier-than-thou elitism is evaporating. The digital explosion has
   democratised technology. Ten years ago Ellis had to dismantle his phone
   and read a dozen websites in order to pull off certain communication
   tricks. An iPhone will now perform most of them out of the box. "It's
   not really geeky to use that level of technology any more," he says. "A
   16-year-old girl using SnapChat on her iPhone isn't a GEEK, she's a
   functioning modern teenager."

   In turn, as cheap technology advances it has colonised what used to be
   the mental playground of the GEEK world, science fiction itself. What
   used to take place in a Gollancz paperback now happens in the real
   world. "A lot of people are arguing that the science fiction novel is
   dying," Ellis explains, "but it's thriving everywhere else, in
   television, fashion, pop culture, everywhere."

   The most interesting contemporary science fiction, he thinks, is being
   created in "design fiction". Here, otherwise staid design firms and
   architectural practices visualise future trends much as The Usborne
   Book Of the Future [large PDF] did for 70s kids – but with added
   plausibility underpinned by hard design and science. Design fiction is
   where the GEEK roll up their sleeves and it can be dazzling.

   You've heard of PayPal billionaire Elon Musk's planned
   San-Francisco-to-LA Hyperloop transport system. What about the design
   practice Dunne & Raby's work United Micro-Kingdoms which has just
   finished showing at the Design Museum in London? This thought
   experiment divides England into four distinct new counties with their
   own technologies and cultures. How would you like to live: as a
   Digitarian, a Communo-Nuclearist, an Anarcho-Evolutionist or a
   Bio-Liberal? GEEK-driven ideas such as these liberate science,
   technology and philosophical ideas from the tedious necessity of having
   to carry a plot. As anyone who knows that Arthur C Clarke
   conceptualised the communication satellite before anyone built it
   understands, the true technology visionary thinks GEEK.

   This summer's Topshop T-shirts might be the most conspicuous indicator
   that our culture has been geeked. But it's a fashion moment and it will
   pass. Something deeper and more significant began taking shape in the
   90s, and it's making modern GEEK both broader and more robust than
   previous cultural waves: the advent of the GEEK Girl.

   First digital culture and cyberpunk dragged GEEK out of its Simpsons
   Comic Book Guy dungeon, then internet business culture started to open
   up to self-motivated women with geeky inclinations. In turn Hollywood
   recognised that you can't build an entertainment blockbuster on half of
   the population. GEEK culture is now powerfully feminised, from
   convention cosplay – there's enough material in all those Princess
   Leias to build countless theses on gender identity – to movie
   franchises that at least acknowledge that female viewers exist.
   Enabling it all is a thriving world of GEEK girl sites and blogs such
   as TheMarySue.com.

   It's not that women are just now getting involved," argues Susana Polo,
   managing editor of TheMarySue. "They're just more visible now. Every
   time you think that women are just getting into this stuff you discover
   that the very first Star Trek conventions were organised by women, or
   that women were key to the creation of Doctor Who. The Harry Potter,
   Star Wars and Star Trek fandoms are gender-equalitarian if not
   female-dominated."

   Yet women coming into the GEEK world have found themselves on the wrong
   end of an ugly backlash from men who claim that they're "fake GEEK"
   who are – irony within irony – only getting involved to win attention
   from GEEK boys. We've clearly reached some kind of end point when the
   sort of people who used to be shunned can now think of themselves as
   prize catches. "The idea of the fake GEEK girl, who pretends in order
   to get the attention of GEEK men, is harmful gatekeeping of the highest
   degree," says Polo. "GEEK should welcome people into our world.
   Otherwise it's geekier than thou and it's gross."

   Geekier than thou – who'd have thought it, that the weird values and
   introspective obsessions of this most despised subculture would
   suddenly become something to aspire to? Certainly not the novelist and
   scriptwriter Ernest Cline, a resident of Austin, Texas, who wrote a
   satirical sci-fi novel about a future world shaped by video gaming
   primarily to discover if he could write a book at all. Ready Player One
   went on to become a New York Times bestseller. As soon as he finishes
   his next book, Armada, this year Cline goes straight to to working on
   the screenplay – Universal Pictures bought Armada, unfinished, for a
   seven-figure sum.

   "I was writing these things mainly for myself," he says. "I had no idea
   that any other person would care. They just didn't seem universal, and
   I didn't mind. But it turns out that there are millions of people all
   over the world who share the same interests in pop culture and movies
   and video games. My whole life changed because of that GEEK culture."
   Ready Player One has now been translated into 22 languages.

   Cline thinks that the world going GEEK does not just represent a change
   from the achievement values of the 80s and 90s. It's more fundamental
   than that – it's the end of the 1950s-to-Reaganism Regular Joe mindset
   with all its suspicion of outsiders, intellectuals and, by extension,
   dweebs in short-sleeved shirts.

   "The atomic bomb and the second world war had made people naturally
   fearful of technology, and suspicious of the scientists who had opened
   these Pandora's boxes," he says. "In all the science fiction movies of
   the time you saw rough-and-tumble military guys solve the problems that
   these nerdy, irresponsible scientists had let loose, and that was
   comforting. But in the 80s and 90s you can't sustain that. You see
   GEEK like Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Bill Gates bring miracles into
   being, not least the internet which has changed everything. The GEEK
   becomes the hero."

   But don't the GEEK' obsessions infantilise us in the long run?
   Superheroes, video games, fantasy novels, homebrew computing, movie
   trivia … these are all about retreating into the comforts of
   adolescence instead of facing the world as it is. If the future is
   GEEK-shaped then we're surely just locking ourselves away in the
   metaphorical bedroom.

   "You can't disparage people for celebrating escapism," Cline counters.
   "It's an essential part of how we live now. We didn't evolve to work in
   cubicles and sit in traffic." Our hunter-gatherer instincts, he
   believes, are just as healthily expressed in a video game as on the
   football field. "Huge numbers of our young people effectively aspire to
   be a highly rewarded soldier in simulated televised warfare for the
   entertainment of the masses. How is that right, and yet playing out
   those same instincts in a virtual universe or a fantasy environment is
   wrong? Escapism is part of being an integrated human being."

   Perhaps escapism is what really matters. Maybe that's the reason that
   GEEK is displaying greater longevity and adaptability than previous
   cultural waves. Unlike punk, lad or dance culture, GEEK can take you
   out of your head into a fantasy environment, but its business
   institutions – Apple, Marvel/Disney, TED, MMPORGs and a thousand
   smaller entities – are robust enough to keep a grip on the real world.
   GEEK has the ideas and the money, and it seems the staying power. Who
   can handle the demands of an ever-diversifying world without choosing
   one little area and mastering – or mistressing – it? It's all about the
   GEEK in me. Better get those horn-rimmed glasses on order. And make
   sure they've got lenses.

   Being a GEEK used to create images of social misfits, and less than
   attractive personalities. But,... [+] not anymore. Credit:Shutterstock

   GEEK -the two of us might fit the profile. Yes we have tendencies to
   contemplate things that probably shouldn’t be contemplated. We
   question. We prod. We poke…at everything. And, we’ve been known to
   engage in long, seemingly meaningless conversations about random things
   like: “Is the love of curry a genetic disposition or a socially
   experiential acquisition?” Or, what is the real meaning of the word
   “of?” That’s a valid question, right? Or, is it just geeky?

   Being geeky, according to research by Imgur, is actually cool in
   today’s world—especially among Millennials. In fact, 60% of the 83
   million Millennials consider themselves GEEK compared to just 38% of
   GenXers and Boomers. And, the study also shows that GEEK are the
   trendsetters and influencers (84% of GEEK say people look to them for
   advice while only 60% of non-GEEK say they get asked for advice).

   This is, of course, welcome news for all of us who happen to randomly
   know Peter Parker’s height and weight (yes, we’re referring to the
   fictional character who turns into Spiderman). But, more than that,
   it’s also welcome news for all of us who GEEK-out about our own
   work—passionately probing to innovate, improve, dissect, and lead
   others to the discovery of their best selves.

   We’re GEEK about why people and companies do the things they do. We
   want to understand the reasons Richard Branson is so admired as a
   leader, the reason Stance socks seemingly transformed men’s attire by
   shining a spotlight on our ankles, and the reason Raj (a guy we met at
   the airport traveling from Malasia to Los Angeles for business) is
   feverishly working on a new suitcase prototype that he claims will
   change everything we know about travel.

   The truth is, all of us are GEEK on some level, about something.
   However, we’ve found that most of us don’t focus our inner GEEK on
   utilizing some of the most obvious, and powerful, paths to turn ideas
   into game-changing success. Here are five critical areas you should
   explore if you want to turn your geeky ideas into results.

   1. The Mentor: Yes, we can talk about leaders like Gates, Zuckerberg,
   and Branson. We can hold them all in a mentor-ish spotlight to learn
   all about their accomplishments. But, when it comes to finding a true
   mentor, it’s important to personally know the individual well enough
   that they can teach you both the things they did right, and the things
   they did wrong. “I’ve failed more than anyone I know,” digital
   innovator Jay Samit told us in a recent interview. “There’s great value
   in failure.” Find a mentor that can show you both what you should do,
   and what you should stop doing.

   2. The Hurdle: Finding new ways to solve old problems is not a new
   idea. But, taking ownership of the problem and the outcome might be.
   Bestselling author and media dynamo, Nely Galan recently told us,
   “Ownership is a mindset, and it’s often the biggest hurdle we all need
   to overcome. Stop thinking that Prince Charming (a person, a group, or
   a company) is going to swoop in and save the day. The problem is your
   opportunity. You are the person to solve it.” When obstacles exist,
   it’s important to focus your inner GEEK on the opportunity that’s being
   presented to you

   3. The Silo: Day in and day out you go to the office and probably sit
   next to the same people. When you have ideas, you probably share them
   with the same people each day. But research shows that 72% of award
   winning work stems from people talking to, and sharing ideas with,
   their outer circle—the people you don’t talk to every day. Our friend,
   author Tim Sanders recently told us, “Sales has always been the job of
   salespeople. But, when organizations eliminate the silos, and include
   everyone in the company who has a stake in the sale, they can achieve a
   70% close ratio.” Think about the other people who have a stake in your
   idea. Get out of your silo and talk to your outer circle.

   4. The Beach: Rest and relaxation is important to our well-being. But,
   there’s more to vacation than just dipping your toes in the water. CEO
   and Founder of Sea Side Reservations, Steve Schwab, recently told us,
   “Routines can make us run on autopilot. Going somewhere new, and seeing
   different things, and the different ways people do things leads to
   unbelievable breakthroughs, sometimes from the most unexpected places.”
   He’s right. Whether you travel across the country or across town,
   getting out of your routine and daily environment can inspire fresh
   thinking and analysis for your inner GEEK to process.

   5. The Child: Let’s face it, a lot of the GEEK stereotype focuses on
   science fiction and video games from our childhood. And, although
   there’s probably not a lot we can learn from a Wookie, organizational
   thought leaders like Brenda Hardesty and Sue Baechler are combining the
   science of game-based learning with strategy implementation to deliver
   impressive business outcomes for players of their game aptly called
   the All In board game.  “Game research shows that players retain 75% of
   what they learn, and 45% after six weeks,” said the creators. “That’s a
   stark difference from traditional training methods—where participants
   only retain 4%.” When chasing results, allow you inner child to
   escape—where your projects are filled with wonder, competitiveness, and
   fun.

   Being a GEEK used to draw up images of social misfits, awkward
   conversations, and less than attractive personalities. But, that’s not
   the case anymore, as GEEK have become the global trendsetters and
   influencers. It’s a welcome message, long-awaited, for many of us. …and
   it’s a club we’re not ashamed to belong to—because if you focus your
   inner-GEEK on the areas above, success isn’t too far behind.

Why GEEK is the New Cool

   By Michael Poh in Culture. Updated on November 21, 2021.

   Not too long ago, GEEK, or in better terms, the intellectual computer
   and technology enthusiast, are pretty much undesirable people among
   their peers. You see them with their trademark large black-rimmed
   spectacles with their unmistakable awkward dressings. It is no surprise
   that they appear weird to most people, since they spend most of their
   time in front of their favorite computer screen and barely any time
   socializing.

   Then all of a sudden, GEEK become cool. They are now admired by their
   peers for their superior intellectuality despite their perceived lack
   of sociability. Now we see the rise of ‘ GEEK chic ’ as celebrities like
   Justin Timberlake donned geeky fashion clothing and the inseparable
   geeky specs. GEEK like Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Facebook’s Mark
   Zuckerberg and Apple’s Steve Jobs are now immensely rich, famous, and
   most importantly, worshiped by everyone else for their innovations.

   The world starts embracing the GEEK culture. Video games are more
   popular than ever, and discussions about how to beat the bosses in
   these games are no longer taboo. Technology like iPhone, Facebook and
   Xbox 360’s Kinect become the most talked about topic in social circles.
   All of us await eagerly on the next technological innovation to be out
   and be the first to play on it.

   Wow. So, what actually happened in a span of simply a few decades?

Internet: Savior of the GEEK

   If water is what gives Earth life, then Internet must be what keeps the
   information age alive. The widespread of knowledge through Internet
   means that everyone has access to information never before available at
   such convenience. Those who do not use the internet get cuts off from
   the rest of the world. And guess who lay the path for how the internet
   develops? GEEK.

   mark zuckerberg mark zuckerberg

   Possessing first-hand knowledge on how technology and computer works
   gave GEEK a head-start when internet first surfaced. They were the
   pioneers when it comes to adapting to new innovations, given that their
   passion and capabilities spur them to quickly learn whatever that came
   out on the technological market.

   If you take a look at how the internet develops from day one, you would
   be amazed at how it came to become what it is today. From e-mails to
   chat messenger, from Web 1.0 to 2.0, from forums to social networking
   sites; the possibilities are limitless. When GEEK were in such an
   influential position on setting what will become of one of the world’s
   greatest inventions, they became powerful people.

   Today, as we anticipate how the future of the internet or any other
   technology will be charted out, everything is pretty much under the
   discretion of these so-called GEEK. They have the ability to create
   innovations that could revolutionize the world, just as how the
   Microsoft Windows operating system had monopolized and change the way
   people perceive computer system to be.

   What can be cooler than being that GEEK who has such authority and
   expertise to shape the world?

GEEK Against the World

   In some ways, GEEK are rebels against the world. We see it in Shawn
   Fanning, founder of the infamous Napster, protesting against the music
   industry for charging for music, and open-source software Linux warring
   against giant Microsoft. Then we have ethical hackers, or white hats,
   striving to expose loopholes in computer systems in the hope to improve
   security for the society as a whole.

   Even on a personal level, these GEEK are considered non-conformist.
   They may not seem smart to people who base intelligence on educational
   qualifications, but no one can deny their achievements. Both Bill Gates
   and Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of college (not just any college, but
   Harvard University). Instead of following the conventional and
   conservative path of getting degrees, they both followed their heart
   and still become successful in their fields.

   It’s an admirable feat to go against social norms and establishments to
   stand up for your passion and values. Another thing about that is it
   makes you stand out from the rest like a sore thumb, whether in ways
   good or bad. But in any case, being cool is about being noticed first.
   It’s the same reason why bad asses are deemed cool; they get all the
   attention simply for doing something different.

The Currency of the Information Age

   In a world run by computers and networks, the person who exhibits
   proficiency in such systems wields a significant amount of control over
   the world. Movie portrays hackers as being able to do wonders and bring
   the world to its knees, be it for the better or for worse. Ultimately,
   it boils down to one theme: knowledge is power.

   Google)

   The more you know about how something works, the better you will
   utilize it. If you know how the world works, wouldn’t you have an edge
   over everyone else? This is how it is with GEEK. The world today is
   technology-saturated, and they are the technology and computer
   enthusiast who can understand and use it best.

   The more the world is moving towards a dependence on information, the
   more revered these GEEK are relied upon to deliver the knowledge. So
   you see, the GEEK hold an important status in our society because we
   would eventually be unable to function without their guidance.

   Any more doubts that GEEK are the new cool? Not anymore.

   5 reasons why being a GEEK is cool
   25 May 2018
   It really is hip to be square
   Share
   The worldwide celebration of nerdom is in full swing to commemorate
   international GEEK Pride Day (that’s 25 May for those not ‘in the
   know’).
   [cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg]

   Allegedly selected to honour the release of Star Wars IV: A New Hope
   (25 May 1977), GEEK Pride Day is the brainchild of Spanish blogger
   Germán Martínez, who instigated the inaugural festivities to celebrate
   all things GEEK in 2006.

   Since then, the annual initiative has grown and been adopted the world
   over, with many parties and meet-ups expected to take place across the
   four corners over the next 24 hours.

   To honour the day, here are five amazing, incredible and uncanny
   byte-sized (yes, the pun is intentional) examples about why being a
   GEEK is cool.

GEEK created the new social norms

   Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Google’s Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and
   Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg are all GEEK who revolutionised the way
   people interact with each other.

   Whether it be the way we invite friends out to dinner, organise video
   game gatherings or try to impress work colleagues with big words (who
   hasn’t looked-up ‘verisimilitude’?), these examples all stem from the
   contributions of these mega-nerds (as well as their equally nerdy
   peers).

GEEK are the new handy people

   Computers, tablets, smartphones – nearly every facet of society is
   somehow entwined with technology. But who do you call when these
   devices let us down (or when we have no idea how to use them)?

   GEEK are now the new ‘go to’ people, solving and soldering these
   technical problems when they breakdown to keep business and social
   lives running. To avoid being further embarrassed by your inferiority
   in all things tech, be sure to check first if you simply need to
   “switch it off and switched it back on”.

GEEK are good at trivia

   Nerds know a lot of things. Lots and lots of things. It's why they're
   usually the first on any invitation list for a pub trivia team outing.

   Whether it be Captain James Kirk’s middle name (Tiberius), Mars’
   smallest moon (Deimos) or even the Konami Code (up, up, down, down,
   left, right, left, right, B, A), there is no question that can stump a
   bonafide GEEK.

GEEK make the future possible

   What do Pythagoras, Isaac Newton and John Bradfield all have in common?
   They’re all examples of historical GEEK who followed their passions
   while overcoming criticism (and built proverbial bridges, one
   literally) in order to fulfil their vision to improve society.

GEEK have their very own code of ethics

   As every GEEK’s honourary Uncle Ben once touted, “With great power
   comes great responsibility”.

   Originally known as the Decálogo de derechos y deberes del friki in
   Spanish, the following manifesto is what all GEEK are bound by:

Rights

   1. The right to be even geekier.

   2. The right to not leave your house.

   3. The right to not like football or any other sport.

   4. The right to associate with other nerds.

   5. The right to have few friends (or none at all).

   6. The right to have as many geeky friends as you want.

   7. The right to choose one’s own style.

   8. The right to be overweight and near-sighted.

   9. The right to show off your geekiness.

   10. The right to attempt being as geeky as Morgana Summers, and the
   right to fail. (Topher Stumph came quite close, but he too failed).

   11. The right to develop serious crushes on Randall Munroe, Shane
   Carruth and Bo Burnham, as opposed to say... James Franco. (See #10).

   12. The right to carry a Thesaurus with you at all times, as opposed to
   an iPhone. (See #10)

   13. The right to execute shameless self-promotion via the Wikipedia
   GEEK Pride Day page. (See #10).

   14. The right to falsely assume the surnames Finkleton, Waldman,
   Stratzer and Krukemeyer.

   15. The right to quote Firefly, xkcd or both whenever possible.

   16. The right to take over the world.

Responsibilities

   1. Be a GEEK, no matter what.

   2. Try to be nerdier than anyone else.

   3. If there is a discussion about something geeky, you must give your
   opinion.

   4. To save and protect all geeky material.

   5. Do everything you can to show off geeky stuff as a "museum of
   geekiness".

   6. Don't be a generalised GEEK. You must specialize in something.

   7. Attend every nerdy movie on opening night and buy every geeky book
   before anyone else.

   8. Wait in line on every opening night. If you can go in costume or at
   least with a related T-shirt, all the better.

   9. Don't waste your time on anything not related to geekdom.

   10. Befriend any person or persons bearing any physical similarities to
   comic book or sci-fi figures.

   11. Try to take over the world!

                   Pros & Cons of Being a GEEK While Studying

   Posted By: Harry Thompsonon: January 24, 2020In: Books, Exclusives,
   Features, OpinionNo Comments

   Pros & Cons of Being a GEEK While Studying

   GEEK are often referred to as individuals who are socially inept with
   weird interests, which they are overly obsessed with. As much as this
   cannot be ruled to be a pure stereotype, there is actually the good
   side of being a nerd as there is the downside, which usually is
   exaggerated. GEEK are mostly interested in tech and awkwardly
   fascinating stuff undesirable to their peers.

   They are less related to romantic lifestyles unless they are dating
   their fellow nerds who share common interests. Free essay samples on
   love is a common prescription when they desire to transition from
   platonic to romantic relationships. Nerds try to find the best essay
   about love so as to serve as a guide in a field in which they are
   deficient of expertise and experience.

An Insight into the Lifestyle of GEEK Students

   Living a nerdy lifestyle has its ups and downs, especially while in
   school. At times, it will play to your advantage while other times it
   spins around and places you at a disadvantage. Whichever way it turns
   out, nerds always find a way to embrace the situation and be
   themselves. Here is a highlight of the advantages and disadvantages of
   being a nerd while in school.

Pros:

   A cool nerd takes advantage of their geeky nature to turn things to
   their favor in the following ways.

1. Use studying as an excuse to disconnect from the world

   Statistically, most GEEK are introverts. They dislike crowds and
   partaking in social activities. To lock out friends or shun such
   activities, they bury themselves deep in books of disciplines that
   interest them. Although this is seen as a weird behavior, it aids in
   sharpening their academic edge, hence their knowledgeable nature.

2. Keeps them off drugs

   High schools and colleges constitute the largest markets for drug
   peddlers. Students with loads of time on their hands usually find
   themselves being trapped by these vices. For nerds, online games and
   books act as a shield to drug abuse. Their lifestyle leaves practically
   no time to indulge in such behaviors.

   Furthermore, even if they were to, who would they do it with?

3. Enhances comprehension of complex ideas

   GEEK are perceived as geniuses because of their vast multidisciplinary
   comprehension of issues. Ever wondered why your nerdy friend always has
   an accurate answer to most of the questions or at least a reasonable
   explanation? It’s because they spend a significant amount of their time
   reading and writing on topics and issues that fascinate them.

4. Makes one more desirable to the opposite sex

   A study conducted in an American college found students who were
   labeled nerds to be more desirable to students of the opposite gender
   than their average counterparts. This desire was motivated by their
   mysterious lifestyle and the undivided attention they give to their
   favorite interests.

Cons:

   Did you know that sometimes, bookworms wish they were teenagers who
   enjoyed life the normal way without feeling so much pressure? Just
   sometimes. This is not to say that they are abnormal, but let’s see
   what makes it difficult for them.

1. They are often victims of stereotypes

   Students are comfortable being around people of similar interests and
   likes. Once one deviates from their way of life and portrays an unusual
   lifestyle, they likely to be branded according to their character.
   Nerds who stay away from relationships and girls are likely to be
   thought to be weirdos or gay, even when they are nothing close to the
   closet.

2. Nerds are devoid of social and communication skills

   The introvert nature of nerds limits the development of their social
   and communication skills. Some of them have been said to be great
   writers who produce quality essays that are used as examples to the
   class.

   What happens to oral communication though? Their verbal skills leave a
   lot to be desired. No way can one develop their verbal communication
   skills when they do not talk to people often.

3. More likely to suffer from depression

   Depression is not selective and can affect just about anyone. It is
   worse when it affects nerds. To begin with, it may go unnoticed and
   undiagnosed since their lifestyle mimics that of a normally depressed
   person.

   Secondly, their circle of friends is small, and they may lack someone
   to share their thoughts and problems with. Professional therapy
   services from a psychologist come in handy for them.

Parting Shot

   Nerds are super intelligent; they live independently, irrespective of
   the other students’ lifestyles. Even in classwork, you won’t find them
   scrabbling for the free samples of essays online. They come up with a
   unique piece inspired by their vast knowledge.

   Being geeky is being unique.

                        Is the word "GEEK" good or bad?

   Posted by Joffles 2017-05-10T22:42:10Z

   Water Cooler

   This thread sparked an interesting discussion about the use of the word
   "GEEK." Do you feel that the word GEEK is a derogatory term? Do you
   embrace it?

   Personally, I don't particularly care. People can call me a GEEK, a
   nerd, a bearded sloth or Ultimate-Heart-Breaker-5000!

Is the word "GEEK" good or bad?

       If i had known about this shirt my kids would have worn it too.
       They may call me GEEK in a negative way and i'll ignore it because
       in the end those ignorant folks will come to me anyhow to fix their
       issues and then i can earn from them.

       I don't think "GEEK" has such a negative connotation now. I'm
       called a GEEK about the things I like all the time. To "GEEK" out
       just shows a high level of enthusiasm for something in my eyes.
       Also, quite a few of the richest people in the world like Mark
       Zuckerberg and Bill Gates are considered to be "GEEK".

       If you have nerdy hobbies then embrace your inner dork!
       I'm glad those t-shirts that say GEEK on them are no longer
       considered fashionable. I hated seeing them about. Usually on
       people who you are fairly sure picked on GEEK-kind when they were
       at school.

       GEEK -  GEEK (n.) "sideshow freak," 1916, U.S. carnival and circus
       slang, perhaps a variant of geck "a fool, dupe, simpleton" (1510s),
       apparently from Dutch gek or Low German geck, from an imitative
       verb found in North Sea Germanic and Scandinavian meaning "to
       croak, cackle," and also "to mock, cheat" (Dutch gekken, German
       gecken, Danish gjække, Swedish gäcka). The modern form and the
       popular use with reference to circus sideshow "wild men" is from
       1946, in William Lindsay Gresham's novel "Nightmare Alley" (made
       into a film in 1947 starring Tyrone Power)."An ordinary GEEK
       doesn't actually eat snakes, just bites off chunks of 'em, chicken
       heads and rats." [Arthur H. Lewis, "Carnival," 1970]
       Dork -  dork (n.) "stupid person," 1967, originally U.S. student
       slang, perhaps from earlier meaning "penis" (1964), itself probably
       an alteration of dick. Related: Dorky; dorkiness.

       To be fair, everyone I worked with at ConnectPro (Canadian GEEK
       Squad clone at their Future Shop brand) is now doing very well in
       IT despite having no formal education. I agree that some people in
       that position could be clueless but everyone I worked with was
       working up to something else. When you start getting laptops thrown

Being A GEEK Is Not A Bad Thing

     * by Jack Loechner , Staff Writer @mp_research, May 2, 2016

   According to a new study by Imgur with YPulse, being a GEEK is now a
   positive thing. Not only are they NOT referred to as a “… nerdy person
   with no athletic ability or personal style, with little personality but
   tons of smarts” by Boomers, or “… not confident, Educated,
   Nerdy, Unattractive, Unrelatable, Socially awkward, or Esoteric” by
   GenXrs, but rather “… trendsetters behind pop culture manias and online
   viral content; today’s GEEK are tastemakers” by Millennials.

   While previous generations saw the GEEK label as feeling they had to
   hide their geekier interests, Millennials have embraced being GEEK.
   They’re more likely than Xers and Boomers to call themselves GEEK or
   say they are into geeky things, and older generations are far more
   likely to say they don’t consider themselves GEEK at all. Xers and
   Boomers might have been embarrassed by geekdom, but that attitude has
   changed drastically, says the report.

   Just as Millennials influenced and shaped mainstream culture, they too
   have transformed what it means to be a GEEK, and have inspired millions
   more to embrace the term, says the report. GEEK is now defined as being
   incredibly passionate about your interests, even when those interests
   are unpopular.

   Steve Patrizi, VP Marketing & Revenue, says that “… the study… casts a
   spotlight on how big, how influential, and how important this group is…
    to any business who wants to be relevant in the years ahead…,” and a
   female, non-GEEK says GEEK means someone that has an over-the-top
   interest in something… like a science GEEK ... when you refer to someone
   as a GEEK ... you can expect this person to be somewhat of an expert on
   the topic…”

   For GEEK, Being A GEEK Is Something To Be Proud Of

   As Millennials have influenced and shaped mainstream culture, they too
   have transformed what it means to be a GEEK, and have inspired millions
   more to embrace the term. GEEK is now defined as being incredibly
   passionate about your interests, even when those interests are
   unpopular.

   Being a GEEK is a positive thing for millennials:
     * 12% of millennials (12%) do not consider themselves GEEK at all.
       Being a GEEK today doesn’t mean what it used to. Eighty-two percent
       of millennial GEEK say the GEEK label isn’t a bad thing, which is
       notably different attitude than older generations
     * Only 38% of Xers and Boomers consider themselves GEEK or admit to
       their geeky interests. While previous generations saw the GEEK
       label as an insult, millennials have embraced being GEEK, and
       geekdom is cool.

   Millennial GEEK are more prolific and influential:
     * There are 83 million Millennials in the U.S. and 60% qualify as a
       GEEK and 23% are self-proclaimed hardcore GEEK
     * Today’s GEEK are tastemakers who learn things first and push them
       forward: 82% say their interests grow in popularity, and 89% learn
       about things before the rest of their friends
     * These are the trendsetters behind pop culture obsessions and viral
       content online: 40% of GEEK say they have created a gif, video
       related to their interest
     * 49% say they spread memes, 67% say they know about things before
       they go viral , and 84% say people look to them for advice on a
       topic

   GEEK Are More Interested In Movies, Video Games, Technology, Science,
   Books And Comics Than Non-GEEK.

   GEEK are extremely hard to reach, says the report:
     * GEEK are more likely than non-GEEK to use ad-blockers, with 76%
       saying they have used one, and are more likely to say they’ve never
       seen an ad that they like.
     * 32% of GEEK feel as though brands cannot relate to them. GEEK
       rely most heavily on online communities for discovery, learning and
       decision-making.
     * When asked about learning more about interests, searching for new
       things, or making a decision, 49% of GEEK say online communities
       are their top resource

   The majority of Millennials don’t just think being a GEEK is not a bad
   thing, says the report, they think being a GEEK is a something to be
   proud of. It has become cool to be a GEEK. Thanks to young consumers’
   shifting attitude toward geekiness, the entertainment and interests
   that were once considered just geeky, like superheroes, fantasy, and
   space, have become huge cultural hot topics, and major money makers.

   If the things GEEK were into ten years ago are massively popular now,
   what they’re into today could be the next big thing for years to come,
   opines the report. Millennial GEEK are more likely to have unique
   interests compared to non-GEEK, concludes the report. They’re more
   likely to spot trends before the rest of their peers, and they’re more
   likely to see things grow in popularity after being interested in them
   first. Millennial GEEK are cultural influencers and behind the web’s
   most viral content.

                 Being called a ‘tech GEEK’ is now a compliment

   (BPT)

   8 years ago

   Being called a ‘tech GEEK’ is now a compliment

   (BPT) – Are you the family member or friend who is always called when
   someone’s computer breaks or starts acting up? Do you have a person on
   speed dial whenever you need a website created or program updated? The
   old stereotype of a computer GEEK who’s always wearing a pocket
   protector and glasses with taped-together frames is quickly becoming a
   thing of the past.

   These days, men and women who are able to speak “tech” and fix those
   pesky computer programs are in high demand, both professionally and
   among friends and family. One reason is that more than 80 percent of
   American households have a computer, according to the U.S. Census
   Bureau. When those computers don’t work, who are you going to call?

   When someone calls a person a tech GEEK these days, it’s meant to be a
   compliment, according to a new survey conducted by GMI Research and
   commissioned by Crucial.com.

   Are you single and trying to promote yourself on dating sites? You
   might want to advertise that you’re a tech GEEK, according to the
   Tech-Know Meter Survey. One in three women say they prefer their
   significant other be tech savvy.

   “Americans recognize how prevalent tech has become in everyday life,”
   says Ed Walker, Crucial.com marketing manager. “These findings
   demonstrate that society has warmed to people who are the most capable
   at fixing and improving the devices we rely on, both in our personal
   and professional lives.”

   It’s not just that people want to be friends with tech GEEK – they
   want to become one themselves, the survey found. A majority of men and
   women are interested in improving their personal tech savviness, even
   if it’s so they don’t have to constantly bug a friend for help. And
   while the percentage of people who claim to be tech savvy is heavily
   male, a significant number of women are showing interest, too, making
   the term tech GEEK more gender neutral.

   There’s a good chance you have a tech-GEEK friend, both in your
   personal life and at the office. In fact, you might have several at the
   office. Most industries these days rely on technology to survive, and
   survey respondents say job candidates with tech skills have a stronger
   resume than those who don’t.

   Having a strong list of tech GEEK handy is important if you are not
   one yourself. So the next time someone is introduced to you as being a
   tech GEEK, be sure to get his or her number! And if you can call
   yourself a tech GEEK, wear the title like a badge of honor – and
   depending on how popular you want to be, protect your cellphone number!

The Majority of Americans Believe that GEEK is A Compliment

Lies Damned Lies

   At least, according to the Opinion Research Corporation, who enacted a
   telephone survey of 1000 American adults on the general subject of the
   concept with a margin of error of +/- 3.1%.

   As one might expect, however, there’s something of an age gap at work:

     Two-thirds (66 percent) of Millennials (respondents aged 18-34)
     think being identified as a GEEK is a compliment, while only 39
     percent of respondents aged 65 and older agree. The cultural shift
     in the way Americans perceive GEEK is further evidenced by the
     findings that eight out of 10 (82 percent) respondents feel it is
     more acceptable to be a GEEK today than it was 15 years ago.

   Other interesting findings of the survey include that the target of the
   word GEEK is most frequently considered to be extremely intelligent,
   a good source for advice about technology, and is frequently a person
   with the latest gadgets. But if you really want some fodder for your
   arguments about GEEK in the mainstream, note this: 41% percent of
   ORC’s respondents said they’d rather be a GEEK than a jock, compared to
   22% preferring otherwise.

   Now that we’ve reclaimed GEEK however, there are still some issues to
   be ironed out. “Nerd,” for example, is apparently still derogative. 87%
   of self-identified GEEK would rather be called a GEEK than a “nerd.”
   Oh, and 50% of the respondents still equate geekdom with being socially
   awkward. While I won’t deny my own social awkwardness, but maybe it’s
   something we can all agree to work on?

   Oh! And happy GEEK Pride Day!

Nerd vs. GEEK: How an insult became a compliment

   Now might just be the best time in history to be a GEEK or a nerd. How
   have the definitions and connotations changed over time?

   Are you a GEEK or a nerd? Maybe you don’t want to admit it, but chances
   are you may have some qualities of both in you. But what is the real
   difference between the two terms?
     __________________________________________________________________

   ‘ GEEK ’ comes to us from history, being a term coined all the way back
   in the 1500s. At that time, it was reserved for a person thought to be
   a fool. Another possibility is that it comes from the 18th-century word
   ‘gecken’ used during the reign of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where it
   referred to circus performers who specialized in biting heads off live
   chickens.

   Fast-forward to the 1950s and the word GEEK came to mean what it
   essentially does today, designating someone who is very passionately
   into technology or certain sub-cultures. You can have academic GEEK,
   computer GEEK, film GEEK, Star Wars GEEK, video game GEEK, food and
   fashion GEEK and so forth. GEEK gather collections of objects, facts,
   and mementos related to their obsessive interests, as Big Think wrote
   previously. GEEK can also fix things for you, a fact used by the
   retailer Best Buy in naming its repair division the GEEK Squad.

   A ‘nerd’ could be similarly passionate but focused on achievement over
   collecting, preferring to gain knowledge and skills rather than trivia.
   One fun bit of trivia, however: the term nerd was invented by none
   other than the beloved children’s author Dr. Seuss in 1950 when he
   wrote, “A nerkle, a nerd, and a seersucker too!” in his book If I Ran
   the Zoo.

   [yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7]

   Credit: Dr. Seuss.

   In 1951, a Newsweek article pointed out that the term started to become
   popular as a synonym for a “drip” or a “square” in Detroit, Michigan.
   The usage of the word just spread from there, entering popular culture
   in the 1970s when it was frequently used on the TV sitcom Happy
   Days—the one with Fonzie.

   Here’s how Slackpropagation differentiates between GEEK and nerds:

     “Both are dedicated to their subjects, and sometimes socially
     awkward. The distinction is that GEEK are fans of their subjects,
     and nerds are practitioners of them.”

   While GEEK can have certain cool factors, nerds tend to be thought of
   as overly intellectual and often perceived to be lacking in social
   graces. As a result, more people would admit to being GEEK than nerds.
   Still, like GEEK, modern nerds have reclaimed some measure of pride in
   what was once a more decidedly negative term with the nerds of Silicon
   Valley, in particular, finding that the qualities that once had some
   laughing at them could actually earn them millions (and for some,
   billions).

   Kory Stamper, a lexicographer at Merriam-Webster Dictionary and a Big
   Think contributor, explains how the terms have been reappropriated. She
   explains that ‘nerd’ refers to someone with a depth of knowledge in a
   specific field or topic—making her a true word nerd—while GEEK now
   denotes a technical know-how, a brainy group that is good at
   technology.

     “There was a dip in its usage for a while before becoming more
     popular as more people started learning html and building their own
     websites,” wrote Stamper. “It came back in the mid-1990s, when it
     was still being used disparagingly. There was a slow shift and by
     the 2000s, it began to register a neutral sense.”

   It also bears saying that one of the most popular shows of the past
   decade has been The Big Bang Theory, which celebrates both nerds and
   GEEK. This is a clear example of Slackpropagation’s definition: The
   Big Bang Theory is a show about nerds, made for GEEK. The show makes
   gentle fun of its heroes, who fit most of the stereotypes ascribed to
   these words, but it also helps them become understandable and beloved
   by a massive audience around the world.

   Also of note is that you will now find more people calling themselves
   nerds or GEEK than ever before, signifying the cultural transformation
   of these concepts. Many people are now ready to “own their nerd-dom,”
   as noted by author Neil Gaiman.

   So which one are you, a GEEK or a nerd?

7 Reasons Why Being a GEEK is Awesome

   Let’s talk GEEK. If I were to take some of the official dictionary
   definition of ‘ GEEK ’ and tweek it a little bit to contextualise this
   article…

   Definition of hypnosis GEEK.

   noun: hypnosis GEEK; plural noun: hypnosis GEEK (like those who listen
   to my podcasts, train with my college and come to my hypnosis GEEK
   dinners)

   1. A knowledgeable and obsessive enthusiast.
   “a computer GEEK
   “a hypnosis GEEK

   verb: GEEK; 3rd person present: GEEK; past tense: geeked; past
   participle: geeked; present participle: geeking

   1. Someone who will
   – engage in or discuss hypnosis-related tasks obsessively or with great
   attention to technical and theoretical detail.
   – be or become extremely excited or enthusiastic about a subject,
   typically one of specialist or minority interest.
   “I am totally geeking out over this meta-analysis detailing the
   efficacy of hypnosis as a means of treating dyslexia.“

   I like hypnosis GEEK, and consider myself to be one. I am incredibly
   technical and derive great joy from the theoretical and academic debate
   of my subject. I lecture on the detailed workings of hypnosis, have
   written very evidence based books on the subject, I research hypnosis,
   I have a hypnosis podcast, I write a hypnosis blog, I read academic
   papers on the subject and know the research supporting this field very
   well indeed, but importantly, I get excited about it, I love what can
   be done with hypnosis. I think that qualifies me to be a self-titled
   hypnosis GEEK.

   What actually is a GEEK in general terms though?

   GEEK are a subculture which is growing more and more prevalent in
   contemporary society: previously bullied and marginalised, thanks to
   shows like The Big Bang Theory, Doctor Who (heck, sci-fi TV and films
   in general) and a change in public perception of a number of qualities
   that are considered desirable in an individual, being a GEEK is finally
   becoming cool. Though, they are cool also because they are not bothered
   about being cool. Try being a GEEK to be cool and you simply become a
   hipster, and whether you like twelve-foot-long beards, wearing wooly
   hats during the height of Summer, wearing skinny jeans and lumberjack
   shirts or not, that is not my topic here today.

   Being a GEEK then, according to research by Imgur, is actually cool in
   today’s world – especially among Millennials. In fact, 60% of the 83
   million Millennials consider themselves GEEK compared to just 38% of
   GenXers and Boomers. And, the study also shows that GEEK are the
   trendsetters and influencers (84% of GEEK say people look to them for
   advice while only 60% of non-GEEK say they get asked for advice).
   Although, some places haven’t quite embraced GEEK and GEEK culture
   like others have, now it’s changing. But, more than that, it’s also
   welcome news for all of us who GEEK-out about our own work—passionately
   probing to innovate, improve, dissect, and lead others to the discovery
   of their best selves (or best elements of their professional field, for
   example).

   One of my favourite quotes is by the actor, writer and comedian, Simon
   Pegg:

   “Being a GEEK is all about being honest about what you enjoy and not
   being afraid to demonstrate that affection. It means never having to
   play it cool about how much you like something. It’s basically a
   license to proudly emote on a somewhat childish level rather than
   behave like a supposed adult. Being a GEEK is extremely liberating.”
   Being a GEEK isn’t something to be ashamed of. It’s something to be
   proud of and most definitely an awesome way to be!  Here are a few
   reasons why this is the case (and please bear in mind this entire
   article is written with a certain degree of tongue-in-cheek, though you
   know as well as I do, that never a truer word is spoken in jest,
   right?):

   1. The GEEK brain has an innate ability to focus intensely:
   Some may call it ‘obsessive’, but when GEEK put their minds to a task
   or subject, they will be able to focus on it like no other group of
   people. It’s the reason GEEK can plough through 20 academic papers in
   a single setting, burn through an entire boxset of Breaking Bad in a
   weekend, the reason they keep having to increase the maximum character
   level cap in World of Warcraft, and one of the reasons top tech
   companies are looking for them. Imagine if someone could bring that
   level of laser-like focus to the work that needs to be done, and think
   about how quickly and efficiently any particular project could be
   completed?!

   2. GEEK are defined by their enthusiasm for things:
   “They’re enthusiasts. Not having a life means you get to love things
   with a passion and nobody bothers you about it.” – John Burnside
   In general GEEK are inherently enthusiastic about the things they like
   or enjoy. They source props and replicas of the film and TV objects
   they think are awesome, They will wear t-shirts bearing catchphrases
   while they stand in line for hours to meet the creators and stars of
   the shows they watch obsessively, and they will even occasionally dress
   up as characters they love and go to conventions. Still, they will come
   into work every day with that same energy and enthusiasm.

   If you’ve ever been in a training of mine and heard the way I talk
   about the TV show Red Dwarf, then you know that sci-fi geekery is
   another facet of mine.

   3. A GEEK is surprisingly resilient:
   For some, it may derive from having fun poked at them, or being teased
   about the things they love, but GEEK tend to be incredibly resilient
   and able to bounce back from pretty much anything. That’s why they make
   such good community moderators, able to take the ridiculous abuse of
   internet commenters on the chin and laugh at how stupid it is, rather
   than descending into a depressive shame-spiral and being unable to do
   anything for the rest of the day.

   Resilience in part and parcel of being a GEEK.

   4. The GEEK ‘Mind Palaces’ are vast and full of knowledge:
   Sure, a lot of the knowledge that fills their Mind Palaces might be
   largely useless pop culture references like the term ‘Mind Palace’
   itself, but along with the focus that allows them to concentrate on
   things like technical detail, academia, video games and comic books
   comes a certain sponge-like quality to their brains. Once they see
   something a few times, they can commit it to memory with a surprising
   degree of accuracy, and secret it away in the storage locker facility
   that is the GEEK-brain.

   When you love a subject and have a repeated, consistent devotion to it,
   it is so much easier to retain and recall that information.

   5. GEEK are innovators:
   Have you heard about the new social networking site? Or the latest in
   wearable technology? The new iOS update? No? You would have heard about
   it if you were a GEEK, because GEEK love new technology and love
   sharing news and information about it. Follow a GEEK on Twitter and
   you’ll know all about that stuff weeks before you would have done
   otherwise, usually the moment it’s announced.

   GEEK are usually the ones who have created the latest innovations, and
   GEEK are usually pioneering the field that they work within. Whatever
   field you work in or have an interest in, find a GEEK of that field,
   follow them closely, without stalking them, obviously.

   6. GEEK advocate for the outsider or the uncool:
   GEEK often side with the underdog, or the oppressed and are sort of
   accustomed to being looked upon in unusual ways, made fun of and pushed
   to the edges of society. Because of it, GEEK tend to be amazing
   advocates for the outsiders and the “uncool.”

   However, in every field, you want to hear from those on the fringes,
   those that are innovating and those that have an intensive knowledge
   and enthusiasm.

   7. The GEEK focuses on a person’s strengths and skills, not their
   influence:
   It’s simple for GEEK. How much money you have in the bank, how many
   friends you have and how much influence you have just doesn’t matter.
   Those things aren’t a positive or

   In the hypnosis field, hypnotherapists should be looking at and
   learning from academics, neuroscientists, researchers and credible
   sources of education to further their own career, knowledge and skills,
   yet the masses tend to opt for following those who make the most noise,
   or have the loudest voices. This cartoon strip sums it up for me……
   The truth is, all of us are GEEK on some level, about something.
   However, Most of us don’t focus our inner GEEK on utilising some of the
   most obvious, and powerful, paths to turn ideas into game-changing
   success. Here are two critical areas you should explore if you want to
   turn your geeky ideas into results.

   a) Find a Mentor.
   Yes, we can talk about leaders like Gates, Zuckerberg, and Branson. We
   can hold them all in a mentor-ish spotlight to learn all about their
   accomplishments. But, when it comes to finding a true mentor, it’s
   important to personally know the individual well enough that they can
   teach you both the things they did right, and the things they did
   wrong.

   “I’ve failed more than anyone I know,” digital innovator Jay Samit told
   in a recent interview. “There’s great value in failure.” Find a mentor
   that can show you both what you should do, and what you should stop
   doing. Whether you travel across the country or across town, getting
   out of your routine and daily environment can inspire fresh thinking
   and analysis for your inner GEEK to process. At the very least, be
   around people who can aid the mentoring process and that you can
   progressively learn from. You know the old adage; if you’re the
   cleverest person in the room, you need to change rooms. Go to places
   where you’ll be stretched and have to strive to rise up and meet those
   that are ahead of you.

   b) Explore.
   Rest and relaxation is important to our well-being. But, there’s more
   to holidays than just dipping your toes in the water. Going somewhere
   new, and seeing different things, and the different ways people do
   things leads to unbelievable breakthroughs, sometimes from the most
   unexpected places.

   I don’t just mean this literally. Seek out environments, groups,
   trainings, courses, people and more besides, that starts a journey of
   exploration and discovery for you. Learning, developing and humbly
   wanting to now more is the road of the GEEK.

   Get lost a few times, and you derive a deeper understanding of the
   area.

   Being a GEEK used to draw up images of social misfits, awkward
   conversations, and less than attractive personalities. But, that’s not
   the case anymore, as GEEK have become the global trendsetters and
   influencers. It’s a welcome message, long-awaited, for many of us. …and
   it’s a club we’re not ashamed to belong to—because if you focus your
   inner-GEEK on the areas above, success isn’t too far behind.

   Go embrace your inner GEEK.

GEEK vs. Jocks: How GEEK are Winning the War of Public Opinion

   Fifty-seven percent of Americans believe being called a GEEK is a
   compliment.

   The Conversation: Celebrating Your Inner GeekABC's John Berman
   celebrates International GEEK Pride Day with GEEK experts.

   May 25, 2011 -- It is a rivalry that has stood the test of time,
   tortured many a high school souls and become an iconic battle in U.S.
   culture: jocks vs. GEEK. Today, on International GEEK Pride Day, a new
   survey reveals that GEEK are winning the public opinion war.

   Fifty-seven percent of Americans say being called a GEEK is a
   compliment and more Americans would prefer to be called a GEEK rather
   than a jock, according to a new survey by Modis.

   "People have gone from the vision of the movies 'Revenge of the Nerds'
   and that was what GEEK would be associated with being, to Bill Gates,
   Steve Jobs, considered pretty cool people," said Jack Cullen, president
   of Modis, a provider of information technology staffing. "I point a lot
   of it towards the coolness of Apple and what they've done to bring
   everybody into the forefront of the digital world."

   The survey also reveals that Americans closely associate the word
   "GEEK" with positive attributes such as intelligence and an expertise
   in technology.

   Despite the good will, however, there is a generational divide.
   Sixty-six percent of those 18 to 34 consider being identified as a
   "GEEK" a compliment, while only 39 percent of those 65 and older agree.

   "The association was if you're technically savvy and you're really into
   technology you're tucked away in a corner somewhere and you're nerdy,"
   Cullen said. "You got the pen protector, the white tape over your
   glasses and you're a social outcast. Now you're the coolest guy in the
   room."

   The atmosphere for GEEK in America is changing overall. The vast
   majority, 82 percent of people, believe it is more acceptable to be a
   GEEK today than it was 15 years ago.

   But whatever you do, don't get GEEK and nerds confused. The survey
   showed that people do not see the words synonymously. Self-identified
   GEEK make up 17 percent of Americans and 87 percent of those who
   self-identified as a GEEK prefer the term over nerd.

   "Being GEEK signifies intelligence and coolness," Cullen told ABC News.
   "In the old days it always stood for intelligence, but intelligence
   wasn't always that important and I think there's also a different level
   here of intelligence. The expectation isn't that your this Mensa. The
   expectation is that you understand, embrace and use technology
   everyday.

   "Not only has technology changed our lives and how we use technology,
   but how the perceptions of people have changed as well."

   GEEK by the Numbers:

   [img_bullet_bluedot.gif] 57 percent of Americans consider being called
   a GEEK a compliment.

   [img_bullet_bluedot.gif] 44 percent of Americans would prefer to be
   called a GEEK.

   [img_bullet_bluedot.gif] 22 percent of Americans would prefer to be
   called a jock.

   [img_bullet_bluedot.gif] 66 percent of respondents aged 18 to 34
   consider being identified as a GEEK a compliment.

   [img_bullet_bluedot.gif] 39 percent of respondents 65 and older
   consider being identified as a GEEK a compliment.

   [img_bullet_bluedot.gif] 17 percent of Americans self-identify as a
   GEEK.

   [img_bullet_bluedot.gif] 82 percent of Americans say they believe it is
   more acceptable to be a GEEK today than it was 15 years ago.

   Opinion Research Corp. surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults 18 and older May 4 to
   8 on behalf of Modis.

Is GEEK A Derogatory Term?

   Since I'm still coming down from the high that is Dragon*Con, I've been
   looking in Flickr for pictures of myself and reading articles about the
   Con.

   I came across a post about the Dragon*Con parade and I started reading
   the comments. There were several comments that jumped out as me as some
   people seemed to think that the term "GEEK" was a bad one and didn't
   want to be labeled that way.

   Since this is GeekMom, we embrace the fact that we are GEEK. But I
   think most GEEK can remember a time in their lives when it wasn't cool
   to be a GEEK.

   For me, I was teased a lot in school. Some of the teasing was strange,
   since I was teased for being short which isn't something I could
   control. But I was also teased for being a GEEK.

   I didn't hide my geekdom at all when I was young. I actually embraced
   it as I had a picture of the cast of __*Star Trek: The Next Generation
   *__in my high school locker. As I got into my later years in high
   school I basically thought, "Screw it. I can find geeky friends in
   college." And I did, which make my college experience all that much
   more fulfilling.

   I'm proud to be a GEEK and I don't think it's a bad thing. I didn't
   think it was a bad label even when I was teased for it. As a mom now, I
   do worry that my daughter will be teased when she gets to school age
   since she already has geeky interests. But I do hope that she will find
   her own way, GEEK or not.

   What do you all think about the term, GEEK? Do you use it to refer to
   yourself or do you think is a derogatory term that shouldn't be used?

GEEK Is Now A Praiseword, Not An Insult Apparently

   This is the time of year when the dictionary makers proudly announce
   the changes they've made in their offerings in their continual attempts
   to stay up with linguistic changes. The obvious reason being that this
   is the time of year when most dictionaries get bought. So, out come the
   lists of the years' "top word" ("selfie" according to one publisher)
   and others' point to the way that definitions have changed. The
   announcement from Collins is that "GEEK" is now a term of approbation,
   a praiseword, not the insult we all used it to be formerly.

     Ian Brookes, Consultant Editor to Collins Dictionary, said: “The
     evolving meanings of words are as interesting as brand new words to
     Collins.

     “Often we find that they achieve better longevity too. Just compare
     previous generations’ use of words like ‘cloud’, ‘tweet’ and
     ‘tablet’ to ours.

     “‘ GEEK’ is a great example of a word that has evolved from having a
     negative meaning to having a positive one.

     “Its origins are in the 19th century, but it has most recently
     changed from describing someone preoccupied with computing to
     someone who is passionate about any field of expertise.

   The formal definition is:

      GEEK: a person who is knowledgeable and enthusiastic about a
     specific subject.

   Now the point about such dictionaries is not that they should be
   normative, trying to tell us how we should be using words at all.
   Rather, they are positive, telling us how the majority of our fellows
   are in fact using the word. So the change has come from us
   collectively, not from the dictionary compilers. We have decided to
   change the meaning of the word GEEK into that someone knowledgeable and
   enthusiastic, dropping the older slightly perjorative meaning.

   All of which rather makes sense really as it had been the GEEK making
   all the money this past decade, them pushing the world's technology
   forwards as they do so.

   I should note one thing though: this is English English we are talking
   about here, not necessarily American English. You native speakers of
   that language will have to tell me whether the same thing has happened
   over there.

Is the word GEEK offensive?

   Posted bycodeboomSeptember 16, 2012September 16, 2012Posted
   inUncategorizedTags:chic, culture, GEEK, offensive, word

   Yesterday morning I had an interesting tweet conversation with
   @ianskenny about the word GEEK after I had mentioned @mcrgirlgeeks in
   a previous tweet. His opinion is as follows:

     I find the word ‘ GEEK ’ particularly unhelpful…   because I believe
     it’s an ‘excluding’ word that doesn’t attract modern young girls, or
     boys. It’s used pejoratively…   It’s not about how existing ‘ GEEK ’
     feel about it, it’s about how it’s perceived in the wider world,
     particularly youth.

   I respectfully disagree with this opinion, for the following reasons:

   1. What’s the alternative

   I looked on dictionary.com and found this definition of the word
   ‘ GEEK ’:

     1. a computer expert or enthusiast
     2. a peculiar or otherwise dislikable person, especially one who
     is perceived to be overly intellectual

   So…what exactly is wrong with being an expert on computers, an
   intellectual, or choosing not to follow convention? Some people choose
   to label others with negative connotations because they are scared that
   they are different. It’s similar to the way I hear the word “gay”
   thrown around with negative connotations e.g. I often hear people say
   “that’s gay” meaning “that’s annoying/bad”. So should we change the
   word “gay” to something else just because some people use it in a
   negative way? I don’t see why, and I don’t see why GEEK should either.
   Wikipedia’s article on GEEK says:

     Although often considered as a pejorative, the term is also often
     used self-referentially without malice or as a source of pride

   When I was at school the word was “boff” (short for boffin).  If we
   were to stop using the word GEEK, someone would just add negative
   connotations to whatever the alternative is. You can’t stop this, so
   you might as well embrace it.

   2. GEEK is a culture

   Watch any American high school movie and you will see the stereotypical
   school groups – the cheerleaders, the jocks, the stoners, the emos, I’m
   sure you get the idea. I just did it! I just used a word (jock) with
   negative connotations to describe someone who is good at sport, yet I
   don’t see hordes of people coming out to defend the sporty lads. Is
   this because they shrug off the ‘insult’ because they are confident
   that their interest in sport alone is enough to weather anything they
   might be called because of it? Maybe we should be teaching our children
   to say “thank you” when they are called a GEEK, rather than to be upset
   by it.

   I was interested to read this article on GEEK culture the other day
   which talks of the new GEEK chic” which seems to be taking over. My
   boss has GEEK glasses” and so do half of the clothing models on Asos.
   I think it is good for students who are interested in computers,
   science and intellectual pursuits to have a culture where they feel
   like they belong. As the article says “many people are drawn to the
   GEEK identity precisely because they enjoy inhabiting a niche
   “outsider” role. It’s a way of eschewing the mainstream” – for some
   this may be more by accident than design, but why deny them the chance
   of identifying with others by outlawing the term ‘ GEEK ’?

   3. Objections to GEEK are not actually about GEEK

   I often read the tweets of Belinda Parmar and @ladygeektv containing
   snippets of things people have said in their book out soon (I’m in
   it…unless they cut my bit :S). Most of the objections from kids seem to
   be about things such as (and I’m paraphrasing) GEEK don’t want to go
   outside” or GEEK have wild crazy hair” or GEEK don’t wash”. Surely
   these characteristics are actually nothing to do with what the GEEK
   identity is all about – computers, not being mainstream and being
   intellectual. You are allowed to like computers and still wash. Hell, I
   straighten my hair and read Cosmopolitan, does that mean I have to
   revoke my membership of geekdom? I’m pretty sure most people would
   object to anyone who didn’t wash, whether they were interested in
   computers or not, so why lump it in as a characteristic of being a
   GEEK?

   I think we (the older GEEK) need to show the younger generation that
   it’s cool to be clever. It’s OK to have an interest in Computing – and
   not because we look or behave a certain way or refer to ourselves as a
   particular word, but because our enthusiasm is so infectious you can’t
   help but want to become involved.

       i think GEEK is a good word. i am proud to be a GEEK. i think it is
       important you sell GEEK as a cool and have people in schools who
       people see as geeky but cool. dare i say it but big bang theory has
       done a lot for that cause as( the first series at least) was
       intelligent and funny.

‘ GEEK ’ is not chic, it’s offensive, says donor

   David Harding: &#8220;Are these words really used affectionately by

   The words GEEK and “nerd” are as offensive as terms of racist abuse,
   the founder of one of Britain’s most successful hedge funds has said.

   David Harding, who built Winton Capital’s £25 billion fortune by using
   complex statistics to analyse financial markets, said that pigeonholing
   people who are good at maths was equivalent to using words like n*****
   or y**.

   “I feel these words [GEEK and nerd] are as insulting as n*****. I find
   it insulting,” said Mr Harding, who has a personal fortune of about
   £900 million and was 131st on this year’s Sunday Times Rich List.
   Speaking to The Times before an announcement that he has donated £5
   million to create a new maths gallery at the Science Museum in London,

GEEK Love: Why the Next Generation of Nerds Is Cool Now

   Kali Sakai

By Kali Sakai

Published on: January 30, 2014

   3 GEEK girls dressed up

   “You have the movie taste of a 12-year-old boy,” my friend Amy joked.

   I had just suggested we see a superhero movie instead of a romantic
   comedy. But this was not a new thing — my most enthusiastic movie
   suggestions have always featured aliens, robots or hobbits. Since I was
   a young girl, I’ve immersed myself in the sagas of comic book
   superheroes, marveled at the mech awesomeness of Robotech, rooted for
   the “rag-tag fugitive fleet” in Battlestar Galactica, and cherished my
   Millennium Falcon spaceship with Han Solo and Chewbacca action figures.

   Yes, I am a lifelong GEEK. And now, in my late 30s, I am also a mom,
   ushering my kids into a generation for which geekiness suddenly is not
   only much cooler, but everywhere.

GEEK defined

   So what is a GEEK,” exactly? Most GEEK are self-proclaimed. One of
   the most common traits of geekdom is having less conventional
   interests, with a slant toward science fiction, fantasy, gaming, comic
   books, cult movies/programs/books and science in general. “Being a GEEK
   might set you apart from the mainstream to the point that you feel a
   special affinity with a stranger who shares the same ‘geekness,’”
   explains Dave Neil, a dad of three from Bellevue.

   GEEK are also known for their love of detail and desire to always know
   more. Corrina Lawson, content director for GeekMom.com, explains that
   GEEK have “an innate and near-insatiable curiosity” driving them to
   seek deeper understanding of everything from everyday subjects to their
   own specific fandoms (a community of fans devoted to a common show,
   story, game or characters).

   Another bona fide GEEK trait is valuing intelligence and imagination so
   much that it becomes a lifestyle and/or a professional choice. “Having
   an all-encompassing hobby can even lead to a career. For me, my
   interest in science has led to one,” says Adrienne M. Roehrich, vice
   president of the board of GeekGirlCon, the Seattle-based organization
   and annual convention celebrating female GEEK.

   Perhaps the most endearing aspect of geekdom isn’t so much what GEEK
   love, but how they love and share it. Today’s GEEK swarm at large,
   organized conventions (or “cons”) where like-minded adults and kids —
   often dressed up in costume — commune. The cons promote GEEK media and
   connect sellers and buyers of all sorts of merchandise. Wil Wheaton, an
   actor from Star Trek: The Next Generation and the de facto “Nerd King,”
   described it best at the 2013 Calgary Expo, when he said his fellow
   nerds in the packed auditorium had traveled from around the world to
   attend the convention “so that we can be around people who love the
   things that we love, the way that we love them.” It’s as simple as
   that.

Yesterday’s geeky teens

   When I first heard Wheaton’s proclamation, a lump formed in my throat.
   GEEK of my generation epitomized the outcast. Movies like Weird
   Science, Revenge of the Nerds and Real Genius captured that awkward,
   misunderstood dweebishness that other GEEK and I lived every day.

   Cyrus Kirby, proprietor of FatherGeek.com, remembers being called a
   GEEK on the school bus and the playground in a way that “was meant to
   suggest I was somehow weird or different in a way that society would
   consider abnormal.”

   But outgrowing the playground didn’t mean an end to the shunning.
   Robert Holladay, a Portland dad and Batman enthusiast, recalls, “Back
   in junior high and high school, GEEK were a very small fringe group
   who were relegated to a back table in the school library."

   Growing up in rural southwest Washington during pre-Internet days, I
   had no way of knowing I’d ever find anyone who would “get me.” It
   proved a paradoxical time: I yearned to “fit in,” but I also wanted to
   escape into my passions, many of them not stereotypically girly. It’s
   an experience many geeky girls of my generation share.

   “When I was growing up, GEEK was a really bad word. So I always knew I
   was a bit different and interested in stuff outside the mainstream,
   especially for girls,” says Lawson of GeekMom.

   It wasn’t until high school that I finally found and was embraced by a
   group of people who shared my love for nerd fodder like sci-fi/fantasy
   movies, comic book heroes and obscure British comedy shows. It was only
   then that I realized being a GEEK might be OK.

‘It’s cool to be different’

   Unlike their parents’ generation, today’s self-identified geeky teens
   don’t face nearly the same ridicule about their interests. Lani, a
   14-year-old from Wilmington, N.C., attends conventions in costume as
   Mom Lalonde, a character from the Web comic Homestuck. The practice is
   called “cosplay” — dressing up as a character from a movie, TV show,
   comic or video game. Cosplay has its own devoted subculture and is
   often prominently on display at events such as comic conventions and
   GEEK movie openings.

   “Cosplay is so much fun, because you can literally dress up as anything
   you want to. The only thing that sucks is how expensive it is. You
   could not choose a more expensive hobby,” Lani laments.

   Social media is helping GEEK to be accepted and embraced, Lani says.
   “Places like Tumblr and Instagram are full of nerds and fandom bloggers
   who enjoy talking about the things that interest them.”

   “Nerds are people who know a lot about what they’re interested in, and
   that kind of culture is becoming more popular,” says Jacob, a
   13-year-old in Los Angeles. “The popularity deflates the nastiness of
   the idea of geekdom.” Jacob is an avid Rubik’s cube solver and loves
   video games. His dad, Robert Holladay, introduced him to GEEK
   interests. As a GEEK, Jacob has it a lot easier than his dad did. Not
   only is current culture on his side, but he also has a parent who is
   wholly supportive of his interests.

   Last October on a rainy weekend in downtown Seattle, more than 3,000
   GEEK and their supporters filled four levels of the conference center
   at the Washington State Convention Center for GeekGirlCon 2013. Gamers,
   exhibitors, panel speakers and staff mingled with attendees, and the
   press was abuzz with the news that, for the first time in its
   three-year existence, the convention had sold out. The weekend-long
   event offered discussion panels, comic illustrators, exhibitor booths,
   celebrity appearances, games tables and a costume contest. Cosplayers
   showed off their character love and eye for detail in costumes ranging
   from a ’60s-era Batgirl, Gears of War and Hello Kitty to The Avengers’
   Hawkeye and Black Widow to all manner of Doctor Who and Star Wars
   incarnations — and beyond.

   Seattle-area friends Grace and Clara, both 15, attended in costumes
   inspired by their most beloved show, Doctor Who, which just celebrated
   its 50th anniversary. Grace was dressed as the 15th doctor, and Clara
   wore a dress resembling the blue TARDIS (a time-travel machine). As
   costumed attendees milled around us during the lunch break, Clara said
   that she thought the best thing about being a GEEK was “marveling at
   human genius.” I asked the girls what they thought had changed about
   being a GEEK since their parents’ generation. “It’s cool to be
   different,” Grace said.

   Wow. When I was 15, I was constantly uncomfortable with being outside
   the norm. Things have sure changed.

A disturbance in the Force

   But life is not yet perfect in all of geekdom. The growing pains of
   transforming from a fringe group into a more visible demographic with
   increasing clout has created some challenges for the larger GEEK
   community. Despite the fact that many GEEK know firsthand how it feels
   to be marginalized and intimidated, in recent years some female con
   attendees, gamers and other GEEK have complained of discrimination by
   their male cohorts.

   “Some GEEK put themselves in exclusionary cliques, [and] a vocal
   minority of male GEEK seems to want to exclude some women,” GeekMom’s
   Lawson says. “Some of them run comic, video game and movie companies.”

   Last year, some female cosplayers were harassed and photographed by men
   without permission at New York Comic Con. It’s disappointing that these
   attitudes still exist in some corners of the GEEK world. But, increased
   awareness of these incidents and media exposure raised an uproar, and
   conventions have since stepped up their policies on attendee conduct
   and are getting better at enforcing consequences for those who violate
   the rules. This is a great move toward keeping cons safe for all
   attendees. But changing hearts and minds is a gradual process that’s
   going to require vocal support from female and male GEEK alike. After
   all, isn’t respect of fellow GEEK a cornerstone of fully loving and
   sharing our interests?

Hip to be square

   Thanks in part to technology, GEEK culture is on its way to the
   mainstream, even as that change makes many proud GEEK shudder.

   “For the first time in human history, we can share our thoughts, engage
   others and have an open discussion with everyone in the world” because
   of technology, says Kirby of FatherGeek. Even if you don’t live near
   other people who share your interests, a virtual community is at your
   fingertips.

   Bill Svitavsky, co-editor of the book Ages of Heroes, Eras of Men and
   an associate professor and emerging services librarian at Rollins
   College in Florida, believes GEEK culture resonates better with the
   current generation because of the ease of access to information.
   Technology has prompted a widespread “culture of commentary,” he says.
   Via the Internet, it’s so easy now to give instant input, strike up
   conversations and rove vast digital grottos (wikis and websites) for
   information on favorite fandoms, characters and celebrities.

   And the appetite for GEEK-centric content only continues to increase.
   The GeekMom audience has consistently grown since the community was
   founded three years ago, Lawson says. GEEK have gone mainstream.”

   This is great news for normalizing GEEK culture. Patton Oswalt,
   stand-up comedian, actor and Star Wars nerd, explained during a Nerdist
   podcast why mainstreaming is a good thing. “You get old enough to know
   that every single thing — punk rock, hip-hop, everything — becomes
   mainstream,” he says. “It has to, so that something else can react to
   it. Staying underground and staying edgy is just as stagnating as
   staying mainstream and bloated.”

   So despite what some die-hards think, the slide of geekiness into
   popular culture is not necessarily a harbinger of doom.

Sharing with the next generation

   Geekdom is righteous fun when shared with kids.

   Science fiction, fantasy, superheroes and Anglophilia all fostered my
   own curiosity, sense of humor and boldness. And I’d really love for my
   kids to be as inspired by geekdom as I was.

   But they are still young, so we’ll start with the basics. I’ll just
   sprinkle a little Yoda, Bilbo, Mr. Sulu, Super Friends and Wesley
   Crusher here and there. I actually gave my infant son a head start by
   decorating his nursery with a Star Wars theme.

   For my princess-obsessed preschooler daughter, I needed an old costume
   to get the ball rolling. Back in the late ’70s when I was 4, I dressed
   as Batgirl for Halloween in a costume my mom made by hand. Decades
   later, while going through some boxes, I stumbled across my cape, ears
   and belt. When my 4-year-old daughter saw them, she immediately
   exclaimed that she wanted to be Batgirl for Halloween, too. It made me
   so proud to see her get that excited and inspired.

   With both Seattle’s Emerald City Comicon and San Diego’s Comic-Con
   International coming up next month, GEEK will again have the spotlight
   at a time when being geeky is more acceptable than ever. Here’s hoping
   that all GEEK — regardless of their age, gender, interests, cosplay
   budget or fandom knowledge — show how inclusive and progressive this
   community can be. It’s where I found my own true identity and where I
   hope my kids might find theirs.

   So say we all.

   Seattle writer Kali Sakai is a lifelong GEEK married to a computer
   nerd. She’d love for their two young children to speak Klingon, Elvish
   or Wookiee someday. But at this point, she’ll settle for her daughter
   liking anything besides pink and princesses.

   When I interviewed other parents for this piece, I asked, “What are you
   excited to share with your kids about being a GEEK?”

   While I had expected answers such as certain movies, shows and
   superheroes, what actually came through was the aspirational side of
   geekdom.

   “I want to teach them to not be ashamed of loving something. I want
   them to grow up knowing that they can experience the world in many
   different ways.”

   — Sara Conway of GEEK-Parents.com

   “It was important to me to share an aspect of the world that encouraged
   creativity and intelligence. It was also important to me to have a
   common interest. We’ve watched nearly every episode of the new Doctor
   Who show together.”

   — Portland dad Robert Holladay

   “Geekdom lets you stay a kid for as long as you refuse to grow up —
   which makes being a parent even more fun. Parents are happy to see that
   they can still be who they are — GEEK — even after they have kids.”

   — Kelly Knox of GeekMom.com

   “I’m really happy that my daughter enjoys going to Dragon Con with me.
   She’s a young teen, and the fact that not only is she willing to go
   [but] thrilled to go with me makes me happy.”

   — Susie Murph of How to Grow Your GEEK podcast

GEEK throughout the ages

   author details Connor Dunster Culture March 17, 2014
   Header image for Interrobang article
   GEEK are not a new phenomenon — they've been around for decades! Take
   a look at how GEEK have changed.
   1920s
   “The word ‘ GEEK ' originates from the Latin word geck, which means ‘a
   fool or freak,'” Brahm Wiseman from Heroes Comics (186 Dundas St.)
   explained. The word was first used in the 1920s to describe circus
   sideshow acts that would perform bizarre acts like biting the heads o
   of small animals and eating live insects.
   1950s
   In the '50s, GEEK was adopted into post-World War II slang, and came
   to mean “a person who is extremely interested and knowledgeable about
   computers, electronics, technology, and gadgets.” GEEK often worked as
   engineers and scientists, developing these machines out of pure
   passion.
   By now, this word had planted its roots firmly into culture and its
   meaning would continue to be shaped for years to come.
   1960s
   By the 1960s, the word GEEK was starting to gain popularity in pop
   culture. It was not only used to describe someone interested in
   technology, but its meaning had expanded to include anyone who was
   intelligent, especially in the fields of math and science. GEEK were
   infiltrating college campuses and starting their own academic clubs and
   fraternities. They were seen now as the short-sleeved shirted,
   pocket-protector wearing, comic book reading, asthma-puer inhaling,
   four-eyed classic GEEK that are parodied in countless television shows
   and movies.
   1970s
   The show Happy Days had huge influence on popularizing the word GEEK,
   using it many times to pick on their nerdier friend and describe the
   uncool kids.
   By now, GEEK were getting much more involved in hobbies like trading
   cards, tabletop games and fantasy novels to transport them to other
   lands. It was a great time for GEEK culture: Dungeons and Dragons was
   released in 1974 and Star Trek and Star Wars were released to a massive
   following of GEEK fans. GEEK began dressing up as their favourite
   characters and snapping up all the action figures, lunchboxes other
   memorabilia they could get their hands on. Now, the word shifted its
   meaning again, and now included any GEEK who had a strong passion for
   science fiction.
   1980s
   GEEK culture was at an all-time high in the '80s, and for the first
   time, much of GEEK culture was embraced by others.
   Video games started to become very popular during this time, and from
   this came a new kind of GEEK: the gamer. GEEK began filling up
   arcades, spending an allowance's worth of quarters and buying the
   newest Atari and Nintendo systems to play at home. The GEEK' new pride
   was being the guy who mastered the game and had their high scores
   posted in magazines.
   With computers slowly becoming readily available in middle-class
   households, GEEK were trying their hand at mastering these machines.
   Movies like WarGames, Ferris Bueller's Day O and Weird Science showed
   average teens as “hackers,” breaking into secure government databases,
   changing their grades and, somehow, creating women. People began to
   emulate these computer whizzes and the computer GEEK was born.
   1990s
   At this point, computers were no longer just huge paperweights; they
   were becoming much more complex. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Steve
   Wozniack were busy designing their Microsoft and Apple products,
   showing the world the full potential of what computers could do. These
   GEEK broke away from the white-collar approach to working on
   computers, having long hair and wearing flip-flops and shorts year
   round. They took the industry by storm, making millions of dollars very
   quickly and are considered pioneers in the field, dubbed the Pirates of
   Silicon Valley. Many GEEK realized the future was in computers and
   started getting jobs in website design and IT.
   With the Internet boom, GEEK were not only making tons of money, but
   also sharing ideas and swapping information on message boards and
   forums. People being able to talk to each other across the globe gave
   way for music and movie GEEK, who could discuss their favorite albums
   and films online.
   GEEK now
   GEEK were seen as sociably acceptable” beginning in the 2000s,
   according to Wiseman, and they have become the driving force behind
   modern life. Everything from your o�ce to your home is run daily by
   computers, which rely on GEEK to develop and maintain them.
   Now, geekdom has become an inescapable part of our culture: many
   average people have chosen a side in the Mac vs. PC war and will defend
   it proudly; superhero movies rake in millions of dollars at the box
   o�ce on a regular basis; and online role-playing games like World of
   Warcraft and Call of Duty are drawing players from around the world.
   You might even call ‘hipsters' the newest evolution of the GEEK. They
   wear the GEEK chic” look, including thick glasses and quirky outfits,
   and snag the newest technology as soon as it comes out. They're
   interested in obscure culture, trying to find movies and music that are
   far away from the mainstream before anyone hears about it.
   The word (GEEK) is no longer considered an insult; it's used to
   describe someone who has a passion for a particular interest. “The word
   has been distinguished over the years as something that is quite cool,”
   said Wiseman.

   GEEK are a lot sexier than this these days (Picture: lofilolo)

   In the words of Sherlock’s Irene Adler: Brainy is the new sexy.

   GEEK have taken over the world, and they’re stealing hearts while
   they’re at it. It helps, of course, if you have some nerdy tendencies
   of your own, otherwise the unique passion of the GEEK will go over your
   head.

   So step aside, Barbie dolls and unreconstructed men – here’s why GEEK
   are by far the hottest.

   1. They have totally cornered the cool T-shirt market

   Make way, hipsters, because no-one wears an ironic pop culture
   reference on their chest quite like a GEEK.

   2. Your love of comics/computer games etc makes you irresistible to
   them

   I have been spontaneously proposed to thanks to my knowledge of the
   comic book Doom Patrol. It makes dating within GEEK circles really
   quite easy.

   3. They have self-deprecating wit down to a T

   comics

   GEEK are fully aware of the fact that they are GEEK. They are also
   aware that, in the eyes of some people, that makes them weird. And, as
   everyone knows, self-deprecation is just about the funniest type of
   humour.

   4. They are unbeatable at a pub quiz

   divid

   They live on the internet, so their knowledge is eclectic and thorough.
   But they’re going to struggle with the sports round.

   5. They care more about their interests than their appearance

   The fact that GEEK have such a passionate interest in something means
   that they spend more time nurturing their brain than their appearance.
   Which makes them far more interesting, which, in turn, makes them loads
   sexier.

   6. They can fix your computer

   it crowd

   Being able to save your hard drive and everything on it is basically
   the modern definition of being a knight in shining armour.

   7. They’re generally pretty damn smart

   It’s not often you encounter a dumb GEEK. They are either well-read and
   culturally aware, or scientific geniuses. Both are pretty damn sexy.

   8. They have been exposed to a lot of bad-ass female action heroes

   (Picture: YouTube)
   (Picture: YouTube)

   This means that female GEEK are confident and empowered (which makes
   for a very sexy woman) and the male GEEK are totally comfortable with
   confident women (which makes for a very sexy man).

   9. They share many of your interests

   If you’re attracted to GEEK, it’s probably because you’re one too.
   Which means that you have a lot in common with GEEK. And there’s
   nothing sexier than a having an in-depth conversation about a shared
   passion.

   10. They’re considerate

   GEEK never grew up as the coolest kids. They know what it’s like to be
   on the outside looking in. This can make some GEEK bitter (avoid them
   at all costs). But it makes most GEEK sensitive, considerate and
   inclusive.

   11. Glasses are HOT

   comics 4

   OK, I know, poor eyesight is not a problem unique to GEEK. But GEEK
   are probably less likely to wear contact lenses than people who are
   actively trying to look cool. And glasses have that awesome Clark Kent
   vibe.

   gamer.&quot;

   Gamer Dominique Villanueva in still from the The Doubleclick’s music
   video “Nothing to Prove.”

   There is a strange and pervasive cultural myth that GEEK girls are like
   unicorns—we’re rare and mythical creatures who can’t possibly be real.
   This anxiety over gender is deeply tied to nerds’ concerns about the
   mainstreaming of geekdom.

   Combative male gatekeepers to geekdom—from comic book store employees
   to Magic: The Gathering judges to Comic Con panelists to video game
   developers—have a history of marginalizing, challenging, and harassing
   perceived interlopers. The (mostly) straight, white, male people police
   GEEK culture using concepts like GEEK cred” (having an impossibly
   detailed knowledge of a fandom’s minutia), claims that girls are
   thin-skinned princesses who can’t handle the culture, and implications
   that female nerds are either only tagging along with their boyfriends
   or trying to sleep their way to success. A few years ago, the idea
   spread that “Fake GEEK Girls” are only latching on to current trends in
   popular culture to be seen as cool.

   a geeky girl says 'Hasn't read all 700 issues of batman... neither have
   you.&quot;

   GEEK girl meme by Rachel Edinin.

   What’s ironic about all this is that while television, film, video
   games, the comic books industry continues to mostly cater to presumed
   male audiences—across media, female creators and storylines with women
   at their center are the exception to the rule—women make up at least
   half of people who spend money on geeky media and events.

   For example, take gaming. While many video games exhibit rampant
   misogyny and playable main female characters are rare, an estimated 48
   percent of gamers are female. There are significantly more adult women
   playing video games than there are teenage boys. The videos in Felicia
   Day’s gamer-centric web series The Guild have been viewed more than 89
   million times altogether. But in the mainstream cultural consciousness,
   video games are still seen as the domain of teen boys.

   One place where geeky people actually turn up IRL and confound notions
   of what nerds look like is at conventions. This past year, website The
   Nerdist declared that “Women Totally Dominated This Year’s San Diego
   Comic-Con International 2014.” Also this year, women were the majority
   of attendees at Seattle’s Emerald City Comicon. At least,
   that’s according to a post-con survey conducted by the con’s
   organizers.

   a chart showing that 52 percent of emerald city comicon atendees were
   women

   Without cataloging the preferred gender identification of every
   pass-buyer, and knowing that the number of respondents likely
   represents but a small segment of Emerald City’s 70,000 attendees, we
   can’t necessarily assume that there were in fact, more GEEK girls than
   fanboys at the con, only that women might be more likely to take
   surveys. As The Mary Sue rightly noted, “All that this graphic might
   mean is that the folks who actually care enough about ECCC to want to
   help make it better were majority women.” That might be true—women
   certainly have more incentive to give feedback on how to make GEEK
   spaces more inclusive.

   All this shows that women are not only geeky—we’re invested in geekdom.
   It’s part of our identity and millions of women are working to make
   that culture better. At the fourth annual GeekGirlCon ’14 in October,
   over 7,000 Trekkies, Trekkers, Jedi Knights, Twi-hards, Bronies,
   Whovians, Browncoats, Steampunks, Sherlockians, X-Philes, Saltgunners,
   Scoobies, Potterheads, and even some Muggles turned out to an event
   that explicitly says “no ‘ GEEK cred’ is required” to be part of the
   celebration, or the community.

   To get another picture of the huge part women play in geekdom, look at
   the results of fan-ticketing service Eventbrite’s recent online survey
   of 2,600 convention ticket-buyers. The gender split of fans was nearly
   equal overall and for respondents under 30 (about 45 percent of the
   sample), the split was exactly even at 50/50.

   a chart shows that gender for eventrbrite ticketed events is nearly
   equal

   To that last point, generational factors seem to make a difference in
   who relates to the culture, and how the culture functions within
   communities. At The Daily Dot, Gavia Baker-Whitelaw recounted her
   experience of two conventions this past Summer in London, England: Nine
   Worlds, a relatively new event, and Worldcon, an event in its 72nd
   year. According to Baker-Whitelaw, “Nine Worlds was smaller, younger,
   and catered to a more varied crowd including comics, TV, and fanfic
   followers” and that Worldcon, while a cultural institution, had a core
   demographic of older members who seemed out of touch with the interests
   and concerns of younger GEEK communities. She noted that while the
   programming organizers at Worldcon made conscientious efforts to
   embrace diversity, “older fans who came up through pre-Internet fandom…
   often considered themselves superior to the newcomers.” Nine Worlds, on
   the other hand, went above and beyond to make sure all attendees felt
   welcome and safe, distributing badges with preferred gender pronouns
   and making their code of conduct visible. Additionally, Nine Worlds has
   a robust GEEK Feminism track that includes panels on feminist GEEK
   activism, geeky crafting as a political act, sex work in the works of
   Joss Whedon, and ways to get more women into creative industry job
   positions.

   Newer cons ensure continued success by embracing a wide array of
   geekery and fandoms that to cater to emerging, youthful, GEEK audiences
   through mission-based tone, mood, and environment.

   As GEEK culture evolves, and women become more visible members of the
   community, it’s tempting to assume that GEEK girls’ surging numbers are
   simply the result of the mainstreaming of geekdom. But fangirls have
   been around just as long as fanboys, playing Pac-Man, contributing to
   and editing fan magazines, writing fan fiction, vidding, and
   cosplaying.

   Long before GeekGirlCon or Nine Worlds, girl GEEK were organizers of
   early fan gatherings, fan-based initiatives, alternative media-making,
   and indie publishing opportunities. Bjo Trimble spearheaded a letter
   writing campaign with her husband, John, in 1968 to save the original
   Star Trek series from cancellation—resulting in a third and final
   season for the classic franchise. The Wimmen’s Comix collective was
   formed in the 1970s as a response to sexism and misogyny in the
   underground comix movement. WisCon, the first and foremost feminist
   science fiction convention in the world, held its inaugural con in 1977
   and will be convening their 39^th event in 2015. Some of these geeky
   foremothers were honored at GEEK Girl Con this year: Seattle-based
   radio producer Jamala Henderson organized and moderated a panel on GEEK
   Elders, introducing audience members to four women involved in 1970s
   and 80s Star Trek and Star Wars fan communities. Women have been
   integral to building GEEK communities—history that should not be
   forgotten or overlooked.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Here is a not-at-all comprehensive list of where to find GEEK women
   bypassing the constraints of traditional media (and often sexist
   institutions) to both direct the conversation, create communities,
   and influence GEEK culture. Although they’re now defunct, I should note
   that organizations like Friends of Lulu (1994-2011)
   and Girl-Wonder.org (2006-2013) were essential advocates that promoted
   and encouraged female readership and participation.

   Gamer Girls are under estimated, and there are many of them there that
   can be just as good if not better than their male counter parts. If you
   love Video Games and you're really into them you're a gamer. There are
   many different gamers that are out there . Here's a look of inspiration

The brutal oppression of the Nerds and the GEEK

   The use of the term ‘nerd’ doesn’t quite match the terrible history of
   the ‘n-word’, despite what some people might say

   Venture capitalist David Harding has recently donated £5m to the
   Science Museum for a maths gallery. This is a very cool thing to do, so
   hats off to him.

   He also said that using the terms “nerd” or GEEK to describe people
   is the same as using the worst of racial slurs. His actual quote is “I
   feel these words are as insulting as nigger.” This, many would probably
   argue, is not such a cool thing to do, so hats remain on this time.

   Whether or not the term “boffin” is disparaging has been discussed here
   before, but to compare GEEK and nerd to the N-word? Granted, GEEK and
   nerd have been used in the past as disparaging, insulting terms, nobody
   is questioning that. They may have taken on more positive meanings in
   modern times, you even see people (ie women) being mocked and
   criticised for not being “real” GEEK.

   But if GEEK and nerd have been “reclaimed” as many would argue, it
   illustrates that they needed to be reclaimed in the first place. Nobody
   deserves to be mocked, bullied or shunned purely because they have an
   affinity for maths, or computing, or just lack social confidence or
   have an interest in something beyond that of most people, and the fact
   that this happened so often (and still regularly does) is a bad thing.

   But to compare “nerd” and GEEK to the most offensive of racial
   epithets is surely ridiculous? You may think so, but what you’re
   overlooking is the fact that this isn’t just some random opinion; it’s
   a wealthy middle-aged white man’s opinion! Ergo, it must be considered
   in all seriousness. And, if you look into the tragic and brutal history
   experienced by GEEK and nerds over the centuries, you will see that it
   is a very fair comparison.

   There are many different explanations for the differences between nerds
   and GEEK, but the truth is the terms are interchangeable. The terms
   come from the fact that nerds and GEEK originate from what was known
   as the country of Nerdrovia, located in the Geekistan sea, hence the
   two names were used by the different colonial powers in play at the
   time the GEEK and Nerd people were “discovered”, and have since become
   common.

   Nerdrovia is a large island but the treacherous Geekistan sea prevents
   easy crossing, so the indigenous population was essentially stuck to
   their island, meaning accelerated morphological evolution. Nerdrovia
   has many strange properties, which resulted in many bizarre features
   that shaped the development of the Nerd and GEEK people. The volatile
   geology and unusual weathering led to spontaneous formation of natural
   laboratories and studios, where the people could study and create
   things.

   But the same conditions kept people indoors generally, leading to a
   population with rather pasty complexions and a lack of physical
   prowess. As a result, mating and courtship was based on more
   intellectual pursuits. An encyclopedic knowledge of a specific subject,
   the more unimportant the better, became akin to the elaborate antlers
   of a stag, or a peacock’s tail, and sexual selection took over from
   there.

   Sadly, the European empires eventually discovered Nerdrovia, and
   immediately saw the potential use of the intellectual but physically
   unintimidating natives. The first explorers to arrive sometime in the
   15th century, in the form of big ships filled with arts graduates and
   sports enthusiasts, forced the natives at spearpoint to design and
   create guns, which they then took and forced the same natives at
   gunpoint to design better and more efficient guns, as these first ones
   weren’t too reliable, and then they took those better guns and started
   rounding up nerds and GEEK for export to the home nations.

   Nerdrovia quickly became a battleground as the rival empires sought to
   exploit its useful population and natural resources. Nerds and GEEK
   were scattered across mainland Europe, where they were ruthlessly put
   to work, inventing things and working out complicated problems for the
   various governments and ruling parties. Given their tendencies and
   abilities, Nerds and GEEK weren’t recognised as actual people and were
   usually classed as “a type of abacus”, having no legal rights
   whatsoever.

   As such, it was not uncommon for wealthier individuals or families to
   have several GEEK and Nerds living in their mansions, working in
   cramped custom-made labs and workshops to invent amusing things for
   their “hosts”. Despite their abilities, Nerds and GEEK could regularly
   expect to have their pants pulled up over their heads, or be made to
   sit on their own in the lunch room.

   This continued for some considerable time, until societal changes led
   to GEEK and Nerds being recognised as individuals, with rights and
   some measure of dignity. Despite this, considerable prejudice remained.
   GEEK and Nerds were barred from holding high-level jobs or from
   marrying outside their communities. They were regularly ghettoised,
   forced to live in unhygienic but surprisingly efficient slums. Given
   their marginalised position in society, GEEK and Nerds regularly fell
   inwards and turned on each other, leading to lasting and bloody
   disputes over minor details in celebrated works of science fiction.

   Maybe these days the terms nerd and GEEK have been reclaimed and can be
   used affectionately, but they still stem from the terrible legacy of
   what the GEEK and the Nerds went through to get to this point.

   When you consider all this, then Harding is right to compare GEEK and
   nerd to the most offensive of racial terms. Because if everything
   written above is total and utter gibberish, then Harding has
   effectively said that minor-to-moderate social rejection is the same as
   centuries of brutal exploitation and repression of an innocent people.
   This means that a powerful rich white man has said something extremely
   ridiculous and offensive, and nobody thought to correct him on this.
   And surely the idea that we live in a world where that can happen is
   even more ridiculous, right?

   Right?

   Dean Burnett only realised that this post is basically an elaborate
   version of a Stewart Lee routine after he’d finished it, but still feel
   free to point this out to him on Twitter, @garwboy

Dr. Sonja Falck claims calling someone ‘nerd’ or ‘ GEEK ’ should be a hate

     Should branding someone a 'nerd' be made a hate crime?

     Dr Sonja Falck thinks 'divisive and humiliating' anti-IQ insults can
     have negative effects that last a lifetime, while @Bobby_Seagull
     says the move would trivialise actual 'hate crimes' based on
     disability, race and gender. pic.twitter.com/4woAjRFJWf

     — Good Morning Britain (@GMB) December 19, 2019

   A British psychotherapist stirred up a social media squabble Thursday
   when she suggested on national TV that calling someone a “nerd” or
   GEEK should be considered a hate crime.

   Dr. Sonja Falck, also a psychology lecturer at the University of East
   London, appeared on “Good Morning Britain” alongside Bobby Seagull, a
   mathematician, teacher and writer who describes himself as a “proud
   GEEK.”

   On the program, Falck suggested that ridiculing someone with those two
   terms — and others like “brainiac” and “egghead” — should have legal
   consequences.

   “I think people find it startling because very high IQ people are a
   minority group in society who are very much ignored, they’re not
   understood and largely neglected,” she said. “It is the case that very
   high IQ people very often are bullied at school, for example. They’re a
   target for being bullied quite viciously.”

   In response, Seagull argued that today, many view the GEEK label as a
   badge of honor.

   “While the term GEEK and nerd has historically been seen as being
   negative, people have now embraced the term and seen it as positive,”
   he explained. “I think with GEEK and nerds, if you see it as a
   negative thing, it could be negative, but if you embrace it, actually
   to be a GEEK means a good thing.”

   Still, Falck emphasized that “neurodiversity” — or the differences in
   people’s brains — “is an aspect of individual difference, which really
   ought to be recognized by society.”

   “If you look at those legislations that relate to hate crimes, hate
   crime is simply about somebody being targeted in a negative way for who
   they are,” she said. “And a person with a very high IQ who comes across
   in a different way often is targeted in that way. So I just think
   [it’s] an individual difference that should be respected.”

   Commenters on the “Good Morning Britain” Twitter page largely shot down
   Falck’s argument.

   “I think the ‘nerd’ and the ‘ GEEK ’ have taken ownership of these words,
   flipping from negative to positive,” one user wrote. GEEK chic is a
   ‘thing,’ people want to be them now, if someone attempts to use that as
   an insult today it is laughable. It’s not ‘hate crime’, it’s a
   compliment!”

   “Let’s make every insult a hate crime,” another person commented.
   “Better build a hundred prisons more. Stupidity is dangerous.”

Computer GEEK or computer nerd? Which is most offensive or is neither?

   Asked by Buttonstc (27602 points ) August 22nd, 2013

   “Great Question” (0 points )

   I actually have a ton of mad respect for those proficient with
   computers and tech stuff (since my brain is not the least bit
   mathematical; totally opposite) so if I’m using either term I
   definitely don’t mean it negatively.

   However, I’m curious about how others view those terms, particularly
   those who are tremendously computer savvy.

   Is one word more offensive than the other? Or do you think neither are?
   Are there any better colloquial phrases to replace “computer proficient
   person”?

   Just curious.

   I think that we have successfully adopted both terms as compliments.

   It’s very “in” to be a nerd/GEEK these days, so neither are offensive.

   I find GEEK slightly less offensive as it has connotations of
   competence whereas nerd doesn’t. A nerd is a GEEK without skills.
   jerv (31076 points )“Great Answer” (3 points )
   ucme's avatar

   @Buttonstc Yeah, when used in the right place, freak is a massive
   compliment.
   One of those words that have evolved over time, a positive spin.

   I think neither is really offensive, but that said I do not use either
   term..

   I had a friend in high school who was the definition of a classic nerd,
   he would have fit into the revenge of the nerd movies quite well, but
   he didn’t like being called a nerd, I think he was fine with GEEK
   though. I’m also an uber nerd and have no problems with either term, of
   course my computer skills aren’t anything spectacular. But having
   worked IT Support once for six months I no longer say I don’t know
   anything because as stupid as it sounds, plunging things in was
   actually a problem I had to fix more than once…

   I’ve never liked either term.

   Although it is mildly amusing that back when I was called those as
   insults, those same people are posting cat pictures on Facebook and
   can’t live without the Internet.

   This is all giving me a fascinating perspective on all of this
   terminology.

   @mrentropy

   I can certainly understand why you feel as you do about terms which
   were hurled at you as insults.

   Just for curiosity, is there a colliquial appellation that you would
   prefer that could stand in for the rather torturous “person who is
   unusually proficient with computers” ?
   Buttonstc (27602 points )“Great Answer” (0 points )
   Buttonstc's avatar

   @jerv

   That’s an interesting perspective on the diff between the two.

   Do you remember the short-lived but fondly remembered TV program
   “Freaks And GEEK ?
   Buttonstc (27602 points )“Great Answer” (0 points )
   anartist's avatar

   Neither, if you are into it. As @jerv points out, GEEK implies
   knowledge [witness Best Buy’s GEEK Squad]. It’s a far cry from the
   original meaning of GEEK, when it was used disparagingly to computer
   buffs [another term]— GEEK originally meant “A sideshow freak,
   especially a pinhead retard who bit the heads off live chickens” and
   was used to insult non-jock computer buffs/nerds like Bill Gates was as
   a teenager.

   Meaning changed significantly with “he who laughs last laughs longest.”
   Probably because it once was the most offensive, it is now the least
   offensive. It is worn with pride.

   @Buttonstc Not really. It rarely comes up. I’m just some guy who does

   Nerd is a label that conjures images of a pocket protectors, broken
   glasses held together with duct tape, and buck teeth. GEEK has come to
   mean an otherwise “normal” person who likes nerdy things.

   @anartist

   What a great article that is. Thanks for bringing it to our attention.

   I’m going to repost this link to a gaming site where several of us got
   into a side discussion about children attaching gender stereotypes to
   colors like purple. It then evolved to include careers in computers and
   engineering for women and how expectations are changing.

   (Also one of the women there managed to access about 400 pages of
   computer code related to the inner workings of the game and is
   currently sharung a lot of those insights with all of us. Obviously she
   works in computers.)

   Thanks for this article. Loved it.

Ben Goldacre maps 'nerdy day trips' for GEEK

   "I am a very big fan of nerdy day trips," says Ben Goldacre, journalist
   and author, who's built a massive user-generated map of places for
   GEEK to go.

   In a post on his blog, he describes how he's a fan of abandoned nuclear
   bunkers, sea forts, victorian racecourses, and narrow-gauge railways
   that take you to a power station. We are too, so we wanted to highlight
   the impressive map that he's put together of nerdy landmarks in
   Britain.

   He built it with the help of Jo Brodie, who compiled all the
   suggestions (coming in through Goldacre's blog comments and

   two hashtags) onto a Google map. You can see that map here, and add
   your own suggestions.

   Goldacre says on his blog: "We really want to gather as many as
   possible of the more obscure ones, the clearing with the abandoned
   factory, a strange earth feature of nerd interest, the terrifying power
   station, the water slide park, and so on. Our fantasy is that on any
   given road trip, you will be able to find a nerd stop somewhere along
   your route, or perhaps even plot out a nerd odyssey across the UK."

   To contribute to the map, either tweet the info and location using the
   #nerdytrips hashtag, or add your destinations directly onto the map.

   I rarely use either. They have mostly been co-opted by dullards that
   are neither.

   When I enter a room of my peers I always go "Wassup nerds?"
   The irony is that in fact, I am the nerd.
   I don't use GEEK because that is a stupid word.

   I don’t really like the words but I’d say they have different meanings.
   In my brain a nerd is someone who’s very academic and studies a lot
   where are a GEEK is someone who’s really into something very specific
   such as films, then that would make them a film GEEK. Don’t know if
   anyone else thinks the same or if this is just my interpretation :lol:

   draw a Venn Diagram ( how nerdy is that ? :teehee: )
   the GEEK circle and nerd circle intersect. however there are GEEK who
   are not nerds and vice-versa. geekiness implies some level of physical
   manifestation of weirdness... typically protruding teeth & thick
   glasses; the key feature of nerds is intellectual obsessiveness.
   both GEEK & nerds are definitely non-chadian.

   I say Nerd more.
   They both mean the same thing to me, just that GEEK sounds a bit more
   offensive - hence why i use Nerd.

   "GEEK" is a term that has been appropriated by normies who think it's
   hip and trendy to be obsessed with Dr Who and walk around in their
   Harry Potter themed schoolwear.

   Ah, I remember that one. It was the go-to insult for people who
   actually did their homework in years 7-9.

   I use nerd more. Both are terrible descriptions for basically anything
   but I sometimes throw out nerd as a semi-ironic descriptor. GEEK as a
   word is just horrible sounding and has no place in the English language
   frankly.

   Our go-to was "keeno"... as if paying attention and wanting to do well
   was, er, a bad thing?

   I never use those words because I see them as insults. The only context
   I ever use them in is when I talk about how people thought I was a nerd
   as a child and made fun of me for it, even though I was not a nerd in
   the first place.

   I don't use them. And they're different.
   GEEK are more into like comics and stuff.
   While nerds are academically smart.
   I mean someone could be both.
