   My friends always use "NERD" to describe an intelligent person, but
   when I searched its meaning online, I found that it's not really a good
   word.

   "A foolish or contemptible person who lacks social skills or is
   boringly studious."
   [Oxford Dictionaries]

   I've become so confused with this word.
   Is it an insult or a compliment?

       How much research have you done? NERD has another meaning.

       So who are you going to believe? The dictionary, or your friends?
       (are they native speakers, btw?). But you should have noted the
       second definition from the same source: a single-minded expert in a
       particular technical field (i.e. - a geek). Personally, I don't
       think that particularly implies "intelligent", but perhaps that's
       the way your friends understand the associations.

     * Context and intent are both important here; "NERD" can be an
       insult, a compliment or somewhat "neutral".

   If they are referring to an "intelligent" person like you say then they
   most probably mean:

     a person who is extremely interested in one subject, especially
     computers, and knows a lot of facts about it — Cambridge Dictionary

   Example,

     I'm a real grammar NERD.

   So, no it is not in the bad or negative sense but you still have to be
   careful with this word some people might find a bit offensive to be
   called a "NERD" especially when this word has a first definition that
   is kind of negative.

       It used to be more offensive than it has become. Nowadays it
       borders on being a compliment, in the right context.

       This is one of those terms that is generally positive when applied
       to oneself, but probably isn't safe to apply to others without
       careful qualification. For example, "You like sitting up late at
       night debating the merits of descriptivism? You're my kind of
       NERD!" would be OK, but "You're such a NERD!" without any
       additional context might (still) be taken as something of an
       insult.

     * This may be local to my area/social circles, but oftentimes "NERD"
       is used as a term of endearment used with your closer friends. E.g.
       Saying "What's going on, NERD?" when greeting a group of friends.
       I personally haven't heard it used negatively since I watched
       Revenge of the NERD in middle school (early 2000s).

       @Pants: that's almost certainly local to your area, because to my
       ears (as a self-confessed NERD on many topics), it sounds really
       weird to refer to your friends collectively as "NERD" in the
       example you gave.

   Nowadays it can be good or bad. In the past it was inherently bad, but
   it has undergone the phenomenon of reappropriation, which causes
   insults to become a "badge of honour" for the insulted group.

   In my personal experience, NERD was an insult most (~ 90%) of the time
   until the mid-late 2000s, when the concept of a "NERD culture" became
   surprisingly popular. Of course, NERD as "person who follows NERD
   culture" and NERD as "person who studies too much" do not always
   overlap.

   I don't agree NERD is restricted to intelligent.

   A NERD can use the n word to describe themselves but other people
   should not.

   A NERD can say he is a NERD pack like me.

   As a non NERD there are so many ways to express without using the n
   word. He/she is into computing. He is a car racing enthusiast. All she
   can talk about is medicine.

   He is cryptography NERD from MIT that works for the NSA is OK.

   It clearly does not have the strict negative connotation of the other n
   word. Just making a silly comparison.

   In some language communities, "NERD" is a loaded word; for example,
   when used to describe a boy or man, NERD can carry connotations of
   being easy to push around and/or sexually frustrated. In some language
   communities, it's basically considered inoffensive; but unless you want
   to risk offending the other person, I don't think this a good term. And
   I think that, when speaking to men especially, it's safer to assume
   that the other person considers themselves "dominant" (not like a
   bully; more like, someone you don't f**k with), so best to choose
   language that doesn't convey a disconnect between how you're viewing
   the other person and how they view themselves. This applies w/o much
   qualification when talking to women, too; if you're talking to a woman,
   for example, keep in mind that she may well be elected in as a
   parliamentary MP one day, or become the CEO of a major corporation, or
   end up owning a large and highly successful business, etc. Such a woman
   may not appreciate being called a "NERD", I think.

   A NERD is someone with a drive to study. The driver can exist for any
   of a bunch of different reasons. There are also different areas of
   focus. Eventually, though, a NERD, in order to be a NERD, must have a
   certain "love of the subject".

   And then there are shy NERD, who will cringe upon hearing the word,
   and less shy NERD, who will openly affirm, part of their identity, as
   a NERD.

   For a reference and idea, please see the movie T.G.I.F by Katy Perry,
   which might be able to give you some ideas about why one would be, or
   want to be, or end up being, a NERD.

13 reasons why being a NERD is awesome

   AC_NERD_Comp copy

   Being a NERD is pretty cool.

   Even Mark Zuckerberg agrees, encouraging girls to*be* the NERD rather
   than just date them.

   But if you’re already a NERD, than that’s no news to you. Long have you
   been talking about the new Star Wars and despairing at the long wait
   for the new A Song of Ice and Fire book.

   I mean, now we know it won’t be finished before April, what are we all
   going to do when the new Game of Thrones series comes out and ruins it
   all?!

   giphy (15)

   Yeah. Basically.

   All that panic aside, there are a lot of reasons why being a NERD is
   just the best.

   Here are just 13 of them.

   (If you’re not sure how nerdy you are, we have a quiz for that.)

1) You probably have a higher than average IQ

   giphy (17)

   Well, with an interest in maths, physics and/or literature, it just
   comes part of the package.

   Nothing better than challenging people to a game of ‘how many places of
   pi can you remember’. Am I right?

2) You have a large variety of interests

   Sci-fi, fantasy, games – the NERD universe has no shortage of niches
   you can geek out to.

   It’s particularly fun when the things you like, superheroes for
   example, get really popular all of a sudden. You can either feel smug
   about being ahead of the curve or it’s your turn to shine with endless
   knowledge about it.

3) And you’re hugely passionate about them

   giphy (18)

   I mean, what fun is it being all ‘meh’ about everything in life anyway?

   No one else may like Star Trek but you will find great joy in loving
   every episode of it.

   And that passion can spill over into other areas of your life when you
   find someone who shares them, if you know what I mean.

4) And you’re not as anti-social as everyone thinks

   Comic-Con, anyone? If its existence proves anything, it’s that there’s
   a massive community of like-minded people out there to actively
   socialise with.

   Thousands of NERD literally attend these things. Thousands.

5) And even when on your own…you’re never alone

   giphy (19)

   If there’s one place you know your fellow NERD will be, it’s the
   internet. There’s nothing more fun than giggling together over anime
   memes.

   It really does bring people together.

6) You never have to play it cool

   As Simon Pegg once said, being a geek ‘means never having to play it
   cool about how much you like something’. You can profuse your love for
   Star Wars or Doctor Who and never have a fear of what people think of
   you.

   It’s liberating to be so comfortable in your own skin.

7) We rule and change the world

   giphy (20)

   From Bill Gates to Mark Zuckerberg himself, NERD have been powerful
   movers and shakers in this world.

   I mean, just take a look at what happens if Facebook goes
   down…*shiver*… the world would be saying goodbye to its Tinder and
   Instagram selfies.

8) You have the thickest skin

   giphy (16)

   You were probably the weird one at school who was teased for playing
   Pokemon in the corner of the playground instead of playing football.

   No matter how many insults were thrown your way and or how many of your
   Yu-Gi-Oh cards were hidden though, your nerdy ways were never going to
   change.

   It was tough, but those bullies were not your kryptonite – and you’re
   so much stronger as a result.

9) You are ace at pub quizzes

   You knew that photographic memory and deep interest in niche genres
   of electronic music would come handy one day.

   Intro round? Easy. Tricky politics questions? No problem. You were born
   for this.

10) You’re a good problem solver

   giphy (21)

   NERD will happily spend hours trying to work their way through a level
   in a game or untangle huge amounts of complicated code.

   You’re not afraid of getting yourself right up to your elbows into a
   messy situation.

11) Halloween is just the best

   From your favourite superhero, to an infamous villain – there’s just so
   much to choose from for one of your favourite holiday.

   You always have a great costume idea. Or, y’know, a million.

12) You’re naturally competitive

   BH5Xi

   ‘You’ve a level 76 Breton with great sword skills on Skyrim? WELL… You
   should see my level 80 magic-wielding Dark Elf.’

   And it’s that competitive spirit guides you in many other areas in life
   – from your academic record, to your work ethic.

   A guaranteed hard-worker, you could say.

13) You’re very friendly and accepting… of everyone

   Being weird is a fundamental part of being a NERD, so you’re very
   accepting everyone’s odd little ticks.

   We’re just one big nerdy family really.

	A Historical Timeline of the word " NERD "

   the stone age

   1929: The interjection “nerts”, possibly used because some consider it
   vulgar to blurt out “nuts”, comes into use and enjoys some popularity.

   1938: Ventriloquist Edgar Bergen (father of Candice) debuts a new dummy
   named Mortimer Snerd, which he plays as a slow-talking rural rube.

   1940s: The singular “nert” evolves into a label applied to people,
   meaning someone who is nutty. Its use is not widespread, but has been
   attested among particular groups, one being surfers.

   1950: Dr. Seuss tosses off the nonsense word " NERD " as the name of an
   imaginary animal in If I Ran The Zoo.
   [anerd.png]
   the iron age

   1951: Teen slang in the Detroit area is reported to have adopted " NERD "
   as the fashionable new term for an uncool unhip person, otherwise known
   as a “drip” or “square”. This usage may or may not predate Dr. Seuss’s,
   and may or may not derive from “nert” or “Snerd”, but it definitely
   spread from southeast Michigan.

   1960: The spelling “nurd” comes into use, and predominates for some
   time. It spreads widely among many of the younger generation, from
   hot-rodders to Yale students, but remains relatively little known to
   most of the public.

   1965: The word is by now somewhat commonly connected with bookish
   intellectual types. At MIT the spelling “gnurd” catches on. At this
   time, brainiacs at MIT and similar institutions are known for backward
   clothing styles and outmoded crewcuts. Many of them enjoy trashy
   science fiction.

   game, at MIT

   1968: The “Save Star Trek” movement becomes the first instance of
   successful mass activism to promote an agenda favorable to NERD. The
   event fosters a lasting tendency for NERD culture to treat fandom as
   something to be proselytized.
   [bjo.jpg] Bjo Trimble (left), “the woman who saved Star Trek”

   circa 1972: I hear the word for the first time when my dad (himself a
   high IQ pocket-protected engineer who had only recently ceased rocking
   a crewcut) declares Batman to be a NERD. It briefly becomes my little
   brother’s favorite new word.

   1974: ABC debuts Happy Days, which is set in the 1950s, and popularizes
   the term by using it as a piece of period slang. They usually apply it
   not to smart or socially awkward characters, but to those who try to be
   cool and fail. Usage of the word among viewers skyrockets.
   the golden age

   1975: As the first home microcomputers are announced, National Lampoon
   issues this poster, firmly establishing the stereotype for what the
   word will now mean.
   [lampoonurd.jpg]

   1977: In this watershed year, personal computers reach the mass market,
   which results in raising the visibility of computer and electronics
   experts as a recognizable social class, and over several years,
   accelerating the association of the word with them in particular. At
   the same time, Star Wars brings science fiction fandom into mainstream
   visibility, and a “New Wave” sound starts to emerge in rock&roll,
   coming from bands that are often overtly nerdy, in stark contrast to
   the previously popular “cock rock” style.

   1981: By now several computer innovators have achieved wealth and
   become household names, thereby becoming role models and getting people
   to start thinking of NERD as winners. This trend will expand steadily
   for the rest of the century. New Wave rock moves into the mainstream,
   making stars of NERD like David Byrne and Thomas Dolby.

   1984: The movie Revenge Of The NERD is released. Some people with
   technical interests and skills immediately start to use the word as
   self-description, with a " NERD pride” movement becoming visible a few
   years later.

   1993: As NERD pride becomes fairly well established, and the mainstream
   connotation of the word slowly shifts from disdain to respect,
   Professor Gerald Sussman, a former MIT hacker, tells a reporter “I want
   every child to become a NERD.” (It’s around this time that one of my
   NERD friends took to proclaiming “It’s our world now and you can’t have
   it back!”)
   [Jerry_Sussman.jpg]

   1995: The World Wide Web popularizes mass usage of computer networks.
   Non-experts start creating websites in large numbers, and produce the
   beginnings of today’s distinct internet culture. In this environment,
   minor subcultures become highly visible, and the terms " NERD " and
   “geek” are increasingly used for those seen devoting excessive time and
   energy to fandoms, similarly to how the word “otaku” is used in Japan —
   a term which anime fandom is bringing to America around this time.

   1996: The term “Geek Chic” appears, as high-fashion designers start to
   ape nerdy clothing styles for both sexes — even “flood” pants. Also,
   aintitcoolnews.com appears, and proves so influential that the
   entertainment industry soon begins recognizing NERD fans as both a
   powerful and well-organized interest group, and a lucrative audience
   demographic.

   2000: The bursting of the dot-com stock bubble marks an endpoint to the
   “computer revolution” — it’s now just big business, not the definition
   of success and coolness. This removes some of the excessive glamor that
   has built up around NERD.
   the plastic age

   2001: The first iPod appears. Trendy coolness in technology is now
   associated with entertainment rather than the business world.
   [iPodposter.jpg]

   2003: San Diego Comic-Con grows with extreme rapidity, becoming the
   center of the various fandoms associated with NERD. The public becomes
   steadily more aware of the breadth of " NERD culture”. It becomes common
   for people to describe themselves as NERD or geeks based on their
   fandoms rather than on their skills or temperament — that is, they
   label themselves as such based on what they consume rather than what
   they produce, even as these fandoms increasingly merge into the
   mainstream. Opinion pieces bemoaning mass nerdification start cropping
   up, mainly in conservative media.
   [deadpools.jpg] [nerdification.jpg]

   2007: CBS debuts The Big Bang Theory, bringing the first broad
   depiction of all facets of NERD culture to a mass audience.

   2009: As the word “geek” increasingly pushes aside the word " NERD ",
   some NERD produces this handy diagram for defining the difference
   between them:
   [venndiagram.jpg] see also

   2012: As supposedly nerdy interests such as superheroes and wizards
   take over pop culture, jock types also move into technical fields.
   “Brogrammers” are now a thing.

   2013: “Movie Bob” Chipman sums up where we’ve arrived by observing that
   calling oneself a NERD has now become merely a “commodified lifestyle
   label”, saying nothing about your temperament or skills or social
   history. He also notes that today’s gamers and comic geeks have become
   as prone to bullying as their jock predecessors were.

   2016: Director Paul Feig makes a Ghostbusters sequel with a new
   all-female team. The backlash from an offended minority eventually
   drives him to say, “Geek culture is home to some of the biggest
   assholes I’ve ever met in my life.” Meanwhile, in the fashion world,
   “geek chic” is more popular, and more literal, than ever.

   Nowadays I’d say the best spirit of true nerddom isn’t being carried
   forward by " NERD " anymore... where I now see it flourishing best is
   among the crowd known as MAKERS.

Highly Intelligent But Socially Handicapped: The Psychology Of The NERD

   Ask Dr. Dombeck
   Question:

     My son in his mid-30s, is extremely intelligent, has a Ph.D. in
     Chemistry, and is a postdoctoral researcher at an Ivy League
     University. He has significant social-relationship problems. He does
     not know many of the rules of social interaction, and lacks
     confidence in social situations. Some of his actions are often
     considered eccentric. He is interested in developing social
     relationships. But, he has had no significant romantic relationships
     with the opposite sex (though he has had a couple of brief ones). He
     does have male friends but none very close. He also has non-romantic
     relationships with the opposite sex (even more-so than with male
     friends). He has some minor eccentric behavioral mannerisms. His
     almost always carries a backpack with him, often to the most
     inappropriate places, his dress awareness is weak (by any
     convention), and he has developed other minor unusual mannerisms,
     which discourage potential female partners. He is, though, generally
     considerate, kind, and gentle, he is attractive though short in
     stature (about 5ft2”). He is well aware of his problem and makes an
     effort to deal with his situation (sometimes they are clumsy and
     sometimes with varying degrees of success). He is well liked and
     respected by some of his academic peers, and his research results
     are impressive but he is often not invited to participate in social
     events because he is seen to ‘not fit in’. He interacts well with
     his family and has a loving relationship with his parents and
     siblings. He lives away from home (near his university) and speaks
     often by phone and visits his family occasionally. He is not
     generally depressed (he has many professional successes and is quite
     respected), but his clumsy social skills and lack of romantic
     relationship do depress him. He is generally kind, rational, and
     forthcoming. He readily seeks advice from his close family. He is
     easily insulted in social situations when his is confused or reacts
     inappropriately. When in his element (chemistry, history, politics,
     or near his family) he is confident and imposing, and often humorous
     (he has a keen sense of humor). His main concern is that he will not
     succeed in finding a life-partner and will not raise a family (which
     he dearly wishes to do).

   Answer:

   The implicit question here is "what can be done to help my son?" The
   answer is, that I don’t know exactly, but we can explore some ideas
   about what might be wrong and what a helping process might look like.

   Before trying to address a problem it is generally best to first know
   what is the cause and nature of the problem. So, the first part of my
   response will be to offer you some ideas about what might be happening
   to your son. None of the ideas I’m going to explore here are necessary
   descriptive of your son, but they might help to organize our thinking.

   Your son is a member of a social class often described in colloquial
   terms as NERD. I mean no insult by using this term! I use it in the
   sense of the second of the Answers.Com definitions for the term:

     A person who is single-minded or accomplished in scientific or
     technical pursuits but is felt to be socially inept.

   Meant in this way, the term NERD has utility. It allows us to talk in
   general terms about a group of individual who have similar social
   awkwardness issues. Since I can’t think of a better term to use to
   describe such individuals, let’s talk about the psychology of the NERD.

   Nerdiness exists on a continuum. Some people are a little nerdy, while
   others are very nerdy. The more nerdy you get, the more you tend to be
   oblivious of yourself as a social object and to behave in socially
   awkward ways such as dressing badly or failing to take subtle hints.
   Nerdiness is developmental in some fashion. It tends to come on early
   on in life. People grow out of being NERD; they don’t become NERD in
   later life.

   Because NERD are awkward and un-smooth, they tend to be rejected and
   isolated by peers, and because it is emotionally painful to experience
   such marginalization, they tend to push themselves to be excellent in
   aspects of life that do not require social skills. If they are at all
   smart, they tend to go whole hog into some intellectual pursuit.
   Computer science is a big one for many NERD (or that subspecies of
   NERD who proudly call themselves "geek"), but any non-social
   intellectual pursuit will do. Chemistry fits the profile as would most
   any academic pursuit. The strategy at work is a variation on the theme
   of making a weakness into a virtue. NERD can become very good at their
   chosen fields because they have very little to keep them from devoting
   all of their energy to those fields. These are not balanced people with
   rich social lives. Instead, these are people who spend holidays writing
   papers. I know this because I used to be one of these people.

   The big lie that a NERD tells him or herself is that they will make a
   satisfying life for themselves based purely on their intellectual
   pursuits. For some minority of NERD, this may be possible, but I think
   for many others, the "life of the mind" becomes excruciatingly lonely
   after a while. The problem is though that by the time such people
   realize that they are in trouble, they don’t know how to fix
   themselves. They are so very competent at what they do intellectually
   that they cannot stand the thought of having to go back to being an
   absolute beginner and trying to figure out how to be with other people.
   The whole idea of being an adult who is a virgin (or a relationship
   virgin anyway even if not a physical one) is deeply shameful and
   embarrassing and people tend to avoid dealing with what is deeply
   shameful and embarrassing. What happens is that they know there is a
   problem but when they try to deal with it, they get so painfully
   emotional and threatened that they become defensive and back off the
   project and retreat back to the ivory tower where they stay until the
   next time they get lonely. The other academicians around you sharing
   office space in the tower are by and large also NERD and also socially
   awkward and so they can’t help much. They are good for mutually
   reinforcing the idea of how great it is to work on the chosen field,
   but they aren’t good for intimacy. Too bad because intimacy is, for
   most people, ultimately what gives meaning to life.

   I don’t think anyone has developed a comprehensive theory of what
   causes people to become NERD, but any such theory will have to take
   the following concepts into account if it is ever written.

   Some people’s nerdiness is a function of a condition called Asperger’s
   Disorder which is a mild pervasive developmental disorder on the same
   spectrum as Autism. We’ve got a very comprehensive article about Autism
   and Aspergers available here, but the thing to know about this sort of
   condition is that it involves language and communication deficits which
   have a basis in neurological deficits. The prototypical person with
   Asperger’s learns language reasonably well, but doesn’t seem to
   experience language the same way as a normal person. Some quality of
   emotional transmission is missing. People with Asperger’s can talk in
   odd cadences and/or they may fail to understand social reciprocity such
   that they may manifest an "eccentric and one-sided social approach to
   others (e.g., pursuing a conversational topic regardless of others’
   reactions) rather than social and emotional indifference." (DSM page
   80). The character of Toby in the movie "American Splendor" is one
   reasonable portrayal.

   An alternative kind of NERD is someone who develops a condition known
   as Schizotypal Personality Disorder. To say someone has a personality
   disorder in general is to say that they have grown up with some
   important part of the normal human coping toolkit missing or
   undeveloped. People with personality disorders are developmentally
   delayed in important social-emotional ways that cause them to be "one
   trick ponies" who can only react to the world in a narrow and rigid set
   of ways. When such a person is in their element, all is fine (because
   they know how to cope with their element), but when they go out of
   their element, they lack the flexibility to know how to cope
   appropriately and experience significant problems as a result (or for
   some personality disorders, other people experience significant
   problems).

   Schizotypal Personality Disorder is defined in the DSM (page 701) as
   characterized by, "A pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal
   deficits marked by acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for,
   close relationships, as well as by cognitive or perceptual distortions
   and eccentricities of behavior…". The definition of eccentric behavior
   typically characteristic of Schizotypal PD is beyond simple
   cluelessness about how to dress. It involves the presence of minor
   sorts of delusional beliefs (such as a belief in UFOs or ESP), odd
   perceptions and sensations, odd mannerisms and speech patterns, and
   mild paranoia. Recall the character of Kramer from the television show
   "Seinfeld" and you’ll have a good idea of what this looks like. People
   with Schizotypal PD are thought of as eccentric, weird, strange, or
   different. People tolerate them and may find them amusing but always
   tend to consider them an outsider.

   Having a diagnosable disorder such as Asperger’s or Schizotypal PD
   might qualify a person as a NERD or a geek in some circles, but the
   reverse is not true. There are many NERD who don’t qualify for any
   diagnosable disorder. They may be the way they are for other reasons.
   One primary reason that could push a person towards nerdiness is the
   presence of simple but profound social anxiety. Social skills are
   learned through interaction with other children and adults during
   childhood and adolescence. If you are a very anxious child and avoid
   developmentally important social interactions, you will tend to remain
   delayed in your social-emotional skillfulness. If, because of your
   social anxiety you cease to push yourself to interact and instead
   channel your energy into socially avoidant pursuits the problem becomes
   compounded. Not being a member of intimate relationships means you are
   cut off from important feedback such as how to dress appropriately or
   when it is not good form to wear a backpack. The true NERD will
   rationalize his or her odd social behavior, I think for defensive
   purposes. It is simply very painful to admit to yourself that you are
   essentially incompetent in this very important aspect of life.

   The really important question is what can be done to turn this sort of
   ship around. In order for your son to become more able to realize his
   dreams he will need to get through his avoidance and confront his
   social deficits. He will need to learn how people actually perceive him
   (and he will need to remain able to care about this perception so as to
   be motivated to do something about it). He will need to alter his
   lifestyle so as to make a commitment towards putting himself out there
   in the world with regard to eligible women partners. He will need to
   become less inwardly focused and to learn how to see himself as the
   social object he is. This is going to be painful work. He is likely to
   feel very vulnerable while engaged in this work and perhaps at times
   quite pathetic. In order to best help him make his way through this
   painful learning process and ultimately through the universally awkward
   and painful dating process it may benefit him to have a guide in the
   form of a psychotherapist or other high quality "life coach" with whom
   he can form a trusting relationship, who can give him the social
   feedback he needs, and who can be a stable and comforting force in his
   life as he makes awkward mistakes.  This will need to be a long term
   process I think as the learning that needs to take place is basic and
   the avoidance of this learning is deeply ingrained. To the extent that
   your son’s problems are caused by an actual diagnosable disorder such
   as Asperger’s or Schizotypal, the same goals might apply, but the goals
   to shoot for should be more circumscribed and more modest, and the
   coach figure should an actual licensed therapist experienced in working
   with individuals with the disorder in question.

Joe Blogs: NERD still aren’t cool and here’s why…

   You are a NERD. You NERD.

   That used to be a serious, serious burn but these days it’s something
   of a compliment. As someone who grew up watching 90s teen movies (where
   it was always the goal to become ‘cool’), I must admit this is still a
   bit weird to me. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great that nerdiness isn’t
   derided in the way it used to be and brains are celebrated as much as
   brawn. I just can’t figure out why it suddenly changed. I googled, ‘why
   are NERD cool now?’ and all I found was self-confessed NERD
   congratulating themselves for the achievements of Steve Jobs. There was
   a lot of, ‘we are the best, we are clever, we get the best jobs, girls
   think we’re cool,’ etc. It all got a bit presidential to be honest, so
   I moved on and had a think for myself…

   OK, so what am I talking about? Well, with all the news and
   announcements from San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) taking over the internet,
   it’s got us thinking that the definition of ' NERD ’ appears to have
   changed. Or is it the definition of ‘cool’ that’s changed? Let’s have a
   look at some of the ‘nerdy’ behaviour penetrating the mainstream and
   see if we can’t figure this one out.

Geeky Shows and Films Have Become ‘Culture’

   In at number one, it’s movies and TV. More people now have a real
   answer to ‘Kirk or Picard?’ than ‘cats or dogs?’ and content binge
   culture has taken us from consuming relatively believable content to
   screaming for mind riles and giant, monster, explosion pandas. The
   clearest representation of this can be seen through the transition of
   the Marvel comic book movies, which I’ve spoken about before. In Media
   Intelligence, we’ve archived and categorised tens of thousands of media
   mentions surrounding them, and it’s literally been our job to dig in
   and analyse the progress of the franchise through the years… to be
   NERD. I mean, look at Thor. He looks like Walt Disney himself drew him
   and then encased him in muscle, but he still teaches Natalie Portman
   (who happens to be the black swan!) lessons about the universe that
   equate science to magic. They’re literally aligning brains, beauty and
   badassary as one and the same thing. Similarly, Black Panther; the
   wise, royal, performance-enhancing drug-user of a super-athlete also
   has intricate knowledge of a science unknown to all other top
   physicists. And come on, the most nerdy, brainy,
   awkward-around-other-humans avenger of the lot is Bruce Banner and he
   also happens to be the biggest and most powerful. They pulled off a
   mean tick here, they’ve made the NERD and the cool kids want to be the
   same characters. They identify with the same people…imagine that.

Technology Has Levelled The Playing Field For Dweebs

   Not only that, cool kids and NERD are getting more similar interests.
   When I was a kid, computer games were considered to be ‘children’s
   toys’ and adults that played them fell into two categories; ‘supportive
   parents’ and ‘losers’. Not anymore! Today, gaming is a $140 billion a
   year industry that seriously caters to all ages and cultures… and it’s
   called ‘gaming’, it’s got a name now, it’s gone legit. The recent story
   about Keanu Reeves featuring in the game, Cyberpunk 2077, definitely
   kept us busy at DMS; especially since Reeves was instrumental in
   beginning the ' NERD  are cool’ movement when he played Neo in The
   Matrix. And with more powerful applications of the internet, gamers can
   play against people from all over the world in a safe environment. So,
   for instance, playing some iteration of Call of Duty online allows
   people to compete in a physically violent way without any actual
   danger. In fact, it takes genetics out of the equation altogether and
   the only thing that really matters is your ability to play the game/how
   many hours you’ve stayed up playing it instead of sleeping just to get
   good enough. It’s a NERD’s dream because it doesn’t matter how big your
   opponent is in real life, or how confident they are, how utterly
   desired they are by everyone they meet and how easy they find it to
   connect with others physically, you still shot them in the head in that
   game that time. So you win.

Dorks Are Getting Fit!

   The physical thing has taken a bit of a mad turn in recent years,
   though! There’s a network of caves near where I grew up and every
   weekend, groups of kids would go there dressed as elves and goblins and
   stuff to ‘do battle’ with foam swords. kind of like a dungeons and
   dragons thing. I knew some of these kids and just remember them as the
   nice crowd. That being said, their behaviour was widely considered to
   be pretty tragic and really, to dress up in any kind of costume outside
   of the usual fancy dress fodder and/or overly sexualised Halloween
   attire was as good as tapping the biggest kid in the playground on the
   shoulder and asking them to scar you for life. Then cosplay became a
   thing. Almost over-night, comic book and sci-fi conventions transformed
   from the last bastion of society for geeky teenagers to express
   themselves in public and became a local event at which you could see
   beautiful specimens of human beings bringing these beloved, heroic
   characters to life. I saw a group of guys dressed as the avengers… and
   they all had pecs! And there were groups of female super heroes that
   made all the ironic cowboy hats and leg warmers form fresher’s week
   look like a plumber’s overalls. There’s a sweet spot that’s been here.
   The creativity of the NERD has met the cool kids’ preoccupation with
   appearances and created something that celebrates them both. So, does
   that mean that NERD are now hitting the gym? Or are gym bods with
   jacked up muscles starting to get massively in with Frodo and the gang?

   Actually, it’s both! Like Cate Blanchet and Benjamin Button, we’ve all
   met in the middle. NERD are becoming like the cool kids and the cool
   kids are becoming like the NERD. The process is well underway of
   homogenising any of the previously conceived ideas of ‘coolness’ or
   ‘nerdiness’, which means… NERD DON’T EXIST ANYMORE! NERD can’t be
   cool because they’ve ceased to be… they’ve eaten themselves! We’ve ALL
   eaten ourselves! Because, if everyone is cool, then no one is and if
   everyone is a NERD, no one is, right? Or are we all just posers? But,
   if everyone is a ‘poser’, no one is, which means we all must be legit.
   But if everyone is ‘legit’ then no one is… Hmmm, i’m stuck in a loop.
   Does this mean we can all drop the labels and just be ourselves now?
   That’s a scary thought; I’ll just be myself then. OK, who am I? How do
   I feel? What do I think? Am I enough? Does anyone care…Whoops, i got
   there a bit sharpish. Quick, someone give me another pigeonhole! It’s
   alright really, we’ve got the new Picard trailer to watch. if anyone
   needs me, I’ll be in the comments section.

7 Reasons Why NERD Rule The (Business) World

   Bill Gates once said, 'Be nice to NERD. Chances are you'll end up
   working for one.' Here are the mindsets that 'NERD' embrace that you
   can emulate in your life and business.
   By Matshona Dhliwayo

   Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
   You're reading Entrepreneur South Africa, an international franchise of
   Entrepreneur Media.

   We all know the stereotype: intelligent, but overly awkward,
   unattractive, unpopular, and the butt of many jokes for their thick
   glasses, quirky braces and high-worn pants. Stereotypes aside though,
   and we realise that what society has come to label "NERD' are, in
   reality, a force to be reckoned with.
   Bigstock

   R100-Million Business

   The list of bonafide "NERD' tycoons is endless. Larry Page, Mark
   Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos all reign supreme in their
   fields, with a combined estimated network of over USD250 billion. The
   numbers alone prove it, so much so that Bill Gates, the richest of them
   all, famously cautioned, "Be nice to NERD. Chances are you'll end up
   working for one."

7 Mindsets That Drive Success

   1. The love and respect people deny them growing up they get from what
   they do. Ridiculed, in some cases ostracized, and in extreme cases
   brutalized, they spend more time than most working on their dreams.
   Popularity hinders many from achieving their dreams. It's one reason
   why many jocks don't achieve more after university, while NERD end up
   magnates.
   2. They are obsessed with their hobbies. Spending all of their time and
   energy on them, they inevitably become the best at what they do.
   Research shows that it takes 10 000 hours to master a skill. NERD
   typically dedicate far more to honing their skills early on in life.
   3. They love learning. They don't rely on their teachers alone for
   knowledge; they go beyond the curriculum requirements not just out of a
   desire to get As, but out of a genuine love of knowledge. In many
   cases, they even end up teaching their teachers.
   4. They have more to prove. Having endured years of being treated with
   contempt, they develop an inferiority complex and with it, an
   insatiable appetite to outdo everyone. They not only want to prove they
   deserve society's acceptance, but honor and adulation as well.
   5. Pain and isolation are catalysts for creativity. They channel
   negative energy the world throws at them into their work, thereby
   fueling innovation and in the best of cases, genius. Their later
   triumphs are in proportion to their former troubles.
   6. The world already assumes they are intelligent. Such prejudices mean
   geeks don't have to sell themselves as much as everyone. In fact, the
   nerdier they are the smarter they appear, and the smarter they appear
   the more opportunities they receive.
   7. They are not afraid of being themselves. It takes a lot to be
   yourself in a world that is constantly trying to mold you into someone
   else, especially if you are a NERD because you will be teased. But
   being unique, being original is a requirement to stand out. It's the
   only way you can produce products that wow everyone.

Why 'NERD' Are Unpopular

Could so-called "NERD" be popular if they wanted it badly enough?

   Posted April 14, 2011 | Reviewed by Jessica Schrader
     * Share on Facebook Share

     * Share via Email Email

   Upon entering middle school, my once-sensible friend Amy suddenly
   wanted us to spend our time sifting through teen magazines and deciding
   which models were pretty. I was utterly perplexed as to why this was
   interesting, but I tried to offer insightful comments on the Bonne Bell
   lip gloss model's peaches-and-cream complexion.

   As the school year wore on, I dutifully learned our junior high's
   byzantine rules of fashion, makeup, and cliquery. But my heart wasn't
   in it, and my friendship with Amy petered out as she ascended the
   middle school hierarchy. Sometimes I wondered whether I could have
   joined her up there, if only I weren't so.. so... serious.

   But of course I had no choice about being serious. I just was. I loved
   the company of the quirky kids who stayed up til 2 a.m. writing bad
   poetry and published it in the school literary magazine. Eventually I
   became the editor of said magazine; I was the official center of an
   off-center tribe.

   I was doing what felt right, but when I saw Amy in the hallways, I
   always felt a pang. Her new life seemed so enviable, at least from a
   distance. She was always laughing and surrounded by smiling, glittery
   friends.

   I thought of all this when I re-read the investor and programmer Paul
   Graham's brilliant and provocative 2003 essay, "Why NERD Are
   Unpopular." His thesis is that NERD are unpopular because they have
   more important things to think about than seventh-grade personality
   politics. Here he is:

     "...[W]hy are smart kids so consistently unpopular? The answer, I
     think, is that they don't really want to be popular.

     If someone had told me that at the time [I was in school], I would
     have laughed at him. Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable,
     some of them so miserable that they commit suicide. Telling me that
     I didn't want to be popular would have seemed like telling someone
     dying of thirst in a desert that he didn't want a glass of water. Of
     course I wanted to be popular.

     But in fact I didn't, not enough. There was something else I wanted
     more: to be smart. Not simply to do well in school, though that
     counted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or to write
     well, or to understand how to program computers. In general, to make
     great things.

     [But] popularity is not something you can do in your spare time, not
     in the fiercely competitive environment of an American secondary
     school.

     Alberti, arguably the archetype of the Renaissance Man, writes that
     "no art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you
     want to excel in it." I wonder if anyone in the world works harder
     at anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALs
     and neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison. They
     occasionally take vacations; some even have hobbies. An American
     teenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 days a
     year.

     NERD don't realize this. They don't realize that it takes work to
     be popular. In general, people outside some very demanding field
     don't realize the extent to which success depends on constant
     (though often unconscious) effort...The main reason NERD are
     unpopular is that they have other things to think about. Their
     attention is drawn to books or the natural world, not fashions and
     parties. They're like someone trying to play soccer while balancing
     a glass of water on his head. Other players who can focus their
     whole attention on the game beat them effortlessly, and wonder why
     they seem so incapable...."

   When I searched for photos to go along with this post (I googled
   "popularity images"), I found that all the pictures of popular girls
   depict them with shopping bags, just like the above shot of Alicia
   Silverstone from the movie "Clueless"—thus making Graham's point.

   But I don't totally agree with Graham. I think he downplays social
   skills too much. The ability to navigate tricky social situations with
   ease is, in the end, what high schoolers prize, and it's a substantive
   skill that kids like Amy take with them long after they graduate.
   Others learn this skill later in life, as they mature, and they benefit
   from it too. Those who never acquire it are at a real disadvantage.

   Also, some kids are popular not because they're shallow or
   Machiavellian but because they have a winning combination of warmth,
   freedom from anxiety, and social grace.

   But Graham is right that in high school these are the only skills that
   seem to matter. In the real world, other characteristics count too.
   Know-how. Passion. Curiosity. Empathy. Drive. Serenity. Conscience.
   Follow-through. Independence of mind. Creativity. Love.

   The list goes on and on.

   Here is Graham again:

     "In almost any group of people you'll find hierarchy. When groups of
     adults form in the real world, it's generally for some common
     purpose, and the leaders end up being those who are best at it. The
     problem with most schools is, they have no purpose. But hierarchy
     there must be. And so the kids make one out of nothing.

     We have a phrase to describe what happens when rankings have to be
     created without any meaningful criteria. We say that the situation
     degenerates into a popularity contest. And that's exactly what
     happens in most American schools. Instead of depending on some real
     test, one's rank depends mostly on one's ability to increase one's
     rank. It's like the court of Louis XIV. There is no external
     opponent, so the kids become one another's opponents."

   If your child is not the most popular kid in school, if s/he is more
   self-conscious than smooth, then please! Let him or her know that
   there's a life beyond high school, a vastly different landscape from
   one s/he's ever seen, a place with multiple forms of social currency
   and an endless variety of ways to make oneself useful.

   Do you agree with Paul Graham's ideas on popularity? And do you think
   it's even possible to convince kids that there's a life beyond high
   school? After all, they've never experienced it for themselves.

No, NERD Are Not Today’s Cool - by a self-proclaimed NERD

   General
   Sep 14
   Written By Laurie Trueblood

   " NERD are the New Cool” but have things really changed for those that
   are bullied by others?

   The last few years have seen everything from comic book superheroes to
   Dungeons & Dragons in the spotlight. While the media has celebrated and
   flashed headlines like " NERD have taken over,” “Why NERD are
   Popular,” and " NERD are the new cool.”

   Gone are the days of NERD being cast as pathetic losers. Modern-day
   NERD are portrayed as smart, passionate, respectful, and financially
   successful. But for all the positive changes, are today’s NERD truly
   accepted as cool?

What is a NERD?

   NERD is a relatively new word. Its earliest publication was by Dr.
   Seuss in 1950 as a nonsensical word. In If I Ran the Zoo, the main
   character, Gerald McGrew wants to find new bizarre to add to his
   fantasy zoo:
   [q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0394800818&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPla
   ce=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=adventures2au-20&language=en_US]

   “And then, just to show them, I’ll sail to Ka-Troo

   And Bring Back an It-Kutch, a Preep, and a Proo,

   A Nerkle, a NERD, and a Seersucker too!”

   The following year, the word started to take on its more well-known
   connotation when Newsweek published an article discussing the slang
   Detroit youth:

   “someone who once would be called a drip or a square is now,
   regrettably, a NERD, or in a less severe case, a scurve.”

   By the 1970s, the concept of the uncool NERD was fully engrained in our
   culture. In the popular TV series Happy Days, the gullible and clumsy
   character of Potsie was often called a NERD. He was portrayed as the
   opposite to the motorcycle riding, leather-jacketed, and ultimately
   cool Fonzie.

   Ten years later, the modern stereotypical NERD was solidified in our
   culture. NERD were physically weak, lacking all sense of style,
   unattractive, and often wore glasses. They were book smart but lacked
   any street smarts. Unable to develop romantic relationships, they were
   seen as lonely losers that had few friends and were seen as societal
   outcasts.

The Changing Face of NERD

   The boom of Silicon Valley in the 1990s changed the way that NERD were
   seen in the media. Previous outcasts were cast into the spotlight as
   Bill Gates, Larry Page, Steve Jobs, and others became huge successes.

   The 1990s was a boon to fantasy and science fiction as well, both
   classically considered prime NERD territory. Harry Potter was released
   in 1997, and 1999 saw the release of the first new Star Wars movie in
   20 years and the first film in the Matrix trilogy.

   A few years later, Tolkien became mainstream with Peter Jackson’s Lord
   of the Rings in 2001. And former comic books found huge successes with
   Iron Man in 2008 and Man of Steel in 2013.

   It seems that it is no longer considered a bad thing to be a NERD in
   recent times. T-shirts and clothing proudly proclaim their wearer as
   " NERD " and “Geek.” There was the rise of new media like Slashdot, which
   advertised as “News for NERD.” Shows like The IT Crowd and The Big
   Bang Theory have been huge successes. Even a new Spanish holiday was
   created on May 25th - NERD Pride Day (on the anniversary date of the
   release of Star Wars, A New Hope.) And Dungeon and Dragons, once the
   embodiment of nerdom, had its best year ever in 2020.

“I think that NERD, if you want to call them that, have only gotten hipper
and more assimilated into the culture.”

- Al Yankovic.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Modern-day NERD are represented as someone that is highly intelligent,
   interesting, respectful, and very successful. They are still seen as
   socially awkward but typically in a positive, lovable way. NERD are
   seen as passionate about their hobbies and take pride in labeling
   themselves as " NERD.” People self-label themselves as book NERD, food
   NERD, gaming NERD, science NERD, etc., and are seen as those that
   passionately embrace their subjects.

Has it Really Changed?

   The Oxford Dictionary is considered to be one of the most authoritative
   definitions of the English language. But as of 2021, their definition
   of NERD has not changed much and is not overly positive.

   Noun:
    1. A foolish or contemptible person who lacks social skills or is
       boringly studious
    2. A single-minded expert in a particular technical field.

   Intransitive Verb:
    1. Engage in or discuss a technical field obsessively or with great
       attention to detail
       1.1 Be or become extremely excited or enthusiastic about a subject,
       typically one of specialist or minority interest.

   For all the progress, NERD are still seen by many as losers. Students
   that are smart, shy, or socially inept are still the target of
   harassment by their peers. The word " NERD " is still thrown as an
   insult, along with dweeb, dork, geek, loser, and a host of other names
   used by school bullies. NERD are still seen at the bottom of most
   school clique hierarchies and are treated by many as outcasts.

NERD and Bullying

   Whether through physical, verbal, or online harassment or through
   social exclusion, NERD have been the target of bullying by others for
   decades.

   Many modern celebrities that enjoy NERD hobbies will attest to the
   pains of being bullied as children. For example:

   Many successful celebrities that enjoy typical NERD hobbies such as
   comics, DnD, and video games, will attest to the pains of being bullied
   as children.

   And while it can be claimed that these incidents were based on the
   older stereotypes seen in the 80s and 90s, the rates of bullying are
   still high. In the US, one out of five students reports being bullied.
   And up to 65% of bullying is not reported to officials. Another report
   from 2019 claimed that over half the students surveyed stated that they
   had been bullied in the last 30 days.

   The most likely targets with victims of school bullying tending to have
   the following characteristics:

   • Successful academically

   • Creative

   • Introverted

   • Isolated

   • Differentiating physical appearance,

   • Have hobbies, interests, or values different than their peers

   Based on the previous stereotypes, it definitely seems that these
   victims are the NERD of today.

   And for many, that bullying does not end in the classroom. A 2021 WBI
   study on bullying in the workplace found that 30% of Americans are
   bullied at work. And up to 43% of remote workers report being similarly
   harassed.

   The recent pandemic has also seen a rise in bullying against NERD. The
   politicization of science has turned many people against those that
   have a more academic or scholarly background. From news reports to
   neighbors, NERD are often targeted.

   And one of the most ironic forms of bullying by other NERD. There are
   corners of almost every fandom where people have a nerdier-than-thou
   attitude. Newbies and those that lack the time or interest to delve
   deeply into the subject are criticized for not being nerdy enough.
   Ironically, often by those that were themselves bullied for their deep
   interest in the first place.

   Women, in particular, are vulnerable to insults. The concept of “fake
   NERD "  and that women are only pretending to be nerdy in order to get
   attention. It is a sad irony that those girls who have a genuine
   interest in a nerdy hobby are being made to feel like outsiders within
   pursuits traditionally embraced by those that themselves felt like
   outsiders.

The Future of NERD

   While many aspects of NERD culture have become more acceptable and
   mainstream, NERD are not yet fully accepted in our society. Far too
   often, we are still met with insults, bullying, and the term is seen as
   negative by many in society.

   Being a NERD is not just about playing DnD or video games. It’s not
   just about reading fantasy books or being good with computers. Being a
   NERD is about feeling like an outsider and wanting a place to belong.

   We need to continue to support each other and stand up for those that
   are bullied or harassed. Embrace those that want to be part our hobbies
   and remind others that there is a wide world of acceptance out there.

   I want the day where being a NERD is truly awesome. We have made great
   progress, but we still have a long way to go.

     tonight to stand up for the rights of other NERD. I mean uh, all
     our lives we've been laughed at and made to feel inferior. And
     tonight, those bastards, they trashed our house. Why? Cause we're
     smart? Cause we look different? Well, we're not. I'm a NERD, and uh,
     I'm pretty proud of it.”

     Lewis : “Hi, Gilbert. I'm a NERD too. I just found that out tonight.
     We have news for the beautiful people. There's a lot more of us than
     there are of you. I know there's alumni here tonight. When you went
     to Adams you might've been called a spazz, or a dork, or a geek. Any
     of you that have ever felt stepped on, left out, picked on, put
     down, whether you think you're a NERD or not, why don't you just
     come down here and join us. Okay? Come on.”

     Gibert : “Just join us cause uh, no-one's gonna really be free until
     NERD persecution ends.”

What is a NERD?

   NERD is a term that may be used with pride, or one that may be used in
   a derogatory sense. A NERD is typically a person of any race who has
   strong aptitude in the sciences, math, and particularly computer
   science, and who may also be viewed as out of step with popular culture
   in matters of dress, or who is socially awkward. The designation of
   NERD may simply be applied to a person whose uniqueness sets them apart
   from what is considered the "norm," for no particular reason at all.
   The term is first mentioned in the Dr. Seuss book, If I Ran the Zoo,
   which was published in 1950.

   From the 1950s onward, use of the term NERD increased, though drip,
   square, and egghead may have been more popular as synonyms to describe
   NERD. It’s not clear how much the television series Happy Days
   contributed to overall culture in the US and elsewhere, but it did
   bring the term into tremendous usage by the average person, since it
   was used so often in the series. Since Happy Days, most people
   understand the term NERD as that described in the previous paragraph.

   connotations of the word "NERD." Microsoft co-founder is largely
   responsible for reversing the negative connotations of the word "NERD."

   Sometimes people seek to modify the name, and add other descriptions to
   NERD. For instance science NERD are people most skilled at science,
   while music NERD may be those people in high school and junior high or
   middle school who devote most of their free time to music. Both types
   of NERD tend to express high math skills; there is a strong connection
   between musical ability and mathematical prowess.
   [INS: :INS]
   Someone who shows a particular aptitude for science might be called a
   "science NERD." Someone who shows a particular aptitude for science
   might be called a "science NERD."

   As first used in Happy Days the term was anything but flattering. It
   emphasized the social awkwardness of people and made some suggestion
   that interest in science or math was something to be ashamed of. Some
   famous former NERD have certainly proved the lie of this assumption.
   Bill Gates, now one of the richest men on the planet, used his science
   NERD skills to great effect, and perception about being interested and
   innovative in the sciences now may be viewed with positivism rather
   than with censure. Many NERD and non-NERD alike aspire to the Bill
   Gates path.
   [INS: :INS]
   Many NERD have a particular aptitude in math. Many NERD have a
   particular aptitude in math.

   There are also some interesting studies connecting high functioning
   Asperger’s, Non-Verbal Learning Disorder, and high functioning autism
   to nerdism. By nature, people with these conditions tend to have
   extreme trouble in social situations, and may misunderstand others’
   language, range of expression and things like sarcasm, facial
   expression and vocal inflection. Yet, such folks also tend to be
   extremely adept in the sciences. This suggests that discrimination
   focused on NERD may truly be discrimination against several recognized
   learning disabilities and gives people pause as to whether using the
   term in a derogatory fashion is by nature extremely insulting.
   [INS: :INS]

   On the other hand, there are now many kids who think being a NERD is
   something to aspire to. For a while, fashion embraced " NERD chic.” Some
   teachers and educators wish they could do more to inspire students to
   become NERD, but if true nerdiness is predicated on learning
   disability, this may not be possible. There is, however, growing
   respect for this skilled and invaluable member of society, reflected in
   things like Spain’s NERD Pride Day, which has been celebrated since
   2006.

   Somebody was going to create some word that belittled people. It is a
   good thing that this term is now assuming a positive meaning.

   My mate is an all right guy, but when it comes down to it in my opinion
   he is a full on NERD! I mean he's 15 years of age, never goes out
   (unless prompted) and has an unhealthy obsession with anything
   regarding the gaming world. He also loves DrgonBallZ, which for his age
   I find very strange, but I guess it's his choice.

   I definitely think that being termed a NERD has gone from being a
   negative thing, to a positive one that people take pride in. And I
   think it's great that people have gotten to a point where they can be
   happy about being smart.

   I've always thought it was horrible that people were made fun of
   because of their high intellect. Why would we make that into a negative
   thing? Who would want to strive to be dumb?

   In my opinion, there is sometimes a bit of eccentricity that goes along
   with being a NERD, but maybe that's a good thing. People should be able
   to be themselves without ridicule.

   I wasn't aware that the word NERD became so popular by it's use on
   "Happy Days". Being from a different generation, when I think of TV
   being related to NERD, the show "Family Matters" comes to my mind. I
   would think that the character of Steve Urkel on that show, was
   probably one of the most famous television NERD ever.

   I've even known of people dressing in NERD costumes for Halloween to
   look like Steve Urkel.

   Although some people who are considered NERD may have a form of a
   learning disability, I don't think that all NERD do. That would be to
   say that someone like Bill Gates actually has a learning disability.
   I've never heard that he does.

   I also think that the word NERD is now used to describe people who are
   very adept in the sciences, mathematics or technology, but are not
   necessarily socially inept. I've seen a lot people who consider
   themselves to be NERD, and quite proudly, that handle social
   situations very well.

Why NERD rule the world

   At age 16 I was a member of my school's titration team. That is all the
   information you need to roughly gauge how well I got on with girls. And
   bullies. And girls who were bullies. I didn't do well with any section
   of the girl-bully Venn diagram. But it was those experiences that made
   me what I am today.

   While the ability to accurately measure the concentration of chemical
   solutions in a competitive environment is not a skill I now use
   everyday, I definitely use other skills I developed at the same time.
   You cannot explain to your peers that you're off to the chemistry
   department for a practice session without developing all forms of
   survival tactics. Ed Miliband recently admitted that he was a bit of a
   square in his youth, and specialised in solving the Rubik's Cube. You
   cannot walk around with a Rubik's Cube in a north London comprehensive
   school without honing some serious fast-talking skills that will come
   in handy during a later political career.

   School is ironically a difficult place to be nerdy. The school yard
   does not take anything into account other than your image and your
   physical ability (sadly, not your physics ability). These are not areas
   where NERD excel, so to make it through these dark years, generations
   of geeks have developed all manner of coping strategies that have
   served them very well later in life. For the school bully, secondary
   school graduation is the high point of their life; for the NERD, it's
   the beginning of their life.

   I've taught maths in inner London comprehensives and they are full of
   kids having a rough time who will undoubtedly succeed in the rest of
   their life. I remember looking at the members of the maths club and
   thinking "you've just got to make it through these few years and then
   you'll be all right".

   NERD are the richest people in the world. Do not even start on how
   much elite sports people are paid. Sure, Rooney is one of the highest
   paid footballers in the world at £250,000 per week, but the guys who
   founded Google are worth £9.4bn each. Even if he played all 52 weeks in
   a year, Rooney would need to have started playing football in about the
   year 1288 to now be worth that much (around the same year that William
   of Ockham was born, for you history fans). He also has to sweat a lot.
   The Google kids probably just had to put up with a bit of bullying at
   school before writing some clever computing code.

   NERD are also the most powerful. It should come as no surprise that
   our political leaders were a bit square at school. I hope they are
   still a bit square now. Our political and security service halls of
   power are not staffed by the kids who could punch well at school and
   kick a ball a long way (and throw said ball into a thing, or hit it
   with a stick – I forget the details), they're staffed by the kids who
   could wear a Star Trek T-shirt on mufti day and survive.

   The pattern continues in the world of entertainment. The cool kids you
   went to school with now sit at home watching endless repeats of Mock
   The Week on Dave, which is hosted by Dara O Briain with his maths
   degree and stocked with comics who were all the nerdy kids at school.
   There's nothing like a lack of physical prowess to encourage the
   development of lightning fast wit.

   So, nerdy kids the world over, let the cool kids have the first
   quintile of life and all the spoils from the top of the school yard
   food-web. From graduation onwards, your intelligence and studiousness
   will grant you money, power and success. You may even end up as leader
   of the opposition; waiting quietly to be prime minister so you can have
   those bullies from school quietly taken care of.

What Happens When Society Decides That NERD Are Dangerous?

   In Sam Peckinpah’s 1971 movie Straw Dogs, Dustin Hoffman plays an
   ineffectual intellectual, a mathematician, indeed, a NERD, who moves
   with his alluring wife to her hometown, in England. Local rowdies
   continually harass them, until Hoffman’s character executes a violent
   revenge.

   The words " NERD " and “violent” do not usually go hand in hand, but the
   harmlessness of NERD is hardly a settled formula. Along with severe
   emotional disturbance, likely psychosis, and a slowly festering
   decision to carry out the rampage that ended in the deaths of six
   students, as well as his own on May 23 in Isla Vista, California,
   Elliot Rodger, for most of his life, fit the mold of a " NERD.” In his
   manifesto, “My Twisted World,” he noted that video games were his only
   refuge growing up: “I immersed myself entirely into my online games
   like World of Warcraft. I felt safe there.”

   Among recent murderers and would-be murderers, Rodger wasn’t alone in
   his nerdish pastimes. The Newtown Connecticut school shooter, Adam
   Lanza, even more of a loner than Rodger, was addicted to video games,
   including one creepy offering called School Shooting. Two 12-year-old
   Wisconsin girls who, a week after the Isla Vista shootings, stabbed a
   friend 19 times to invoke the imaginary character Slender Man acquired
   their ideas from an online game, as well as the horror urban-legend
   forum creepypasta.com.

   After the Isla Vista killings, commentators quickly linked Rodger’s
   worldview to his lifelong embrace of NERD-culture offerings such as
   Pokémon, Halo, Star Wars, World of Warcraft, and Game of Thrones.
   Arthur Chu, a former Jeopardy quiz-show champion, judged the mass
   murderer’s autobiography as “a standard frustrated angry geeky guy
   manifesto, except for the part about mass murder.” Chu posited that the
   sexist trappings of the video-game world abetted both Rodger’s belief
   that he was entitled to a “hot chick” and his vengeful ruminations when
   he continually failed to connect. Indeed, according to Chu, video-game
   graphics and storylines encourage a more general “rape culture.” He
   concluded it was time for fellow geeks to “grow up” and throw aside the
   sense of entitlement NERD culture engenders.

   This is hardly the first time nerdiness has become associated with
   aberrant behavior. History, however, suggests that NERD panics
   generally say less about geek communities than they do about the people
   doing the panicking—and the uncertainty of the times.

   In 1948, during the early Cold War period, two boys, ages 11 and 12,
   stole and flew a plane in Oklahoma—and said they’d learned how from
   comic books. The same year, a group of avid comic-reading kids in
   Indiana strung up a friend and burnt him with lit matches. Psychiatrist
   Fredric Wertham described a visit to his New York City clinic from a
   distraught mother whose young daughter was continually being assaulted
   by neighborhood boys, none older than nine, who pushed her off her
   bicycle, tied her up in the basement, whipped her, hit her with guns,
   and tore off her panties as they reenacted comic-book scenes. Wertham
   sensed a genuine danger in the era’s action comic books, with their
   glorification of crime, sadomasochism, eroticism, and, in his view,
   proto-fascism. He linked comic books to youth crimes in a series of
   sensationalist magazine articles as well as at the 1948 symposium The
   Psychopathology of Comic Books.

   Panic ensued. In December 1948, religious schoolchildren in Binghamton,
   New York, gathered up 2,000 comic books and burned them, while their
   parents and teachers cheered. Cities passed laws banning or censoring
   comics. Wertham’s 1954 book, Seduction of the Innocent, led to Senate
   hearings that year. Perhaps the high point came when William Gaines,
   future publisher of Mad Magazine, defended a horror comic cover that
   showed a man holding in one hand an axe covered with blood, and in the
   other, a woman’s severed head. Gaines noted, “A cover in bad taste, for
   example, might be defined as holding the head a little higher so that
   the neck could be seen dripping blood from it.”

   Senator Estes Kefauver responded, “You have blood coming out of her
   mouth.” Gaines replied, “A little.” Soon after, the industry
   established the Comics Code Authority to monitor comics, with
   guidelines similar to the 1930 Hays Code for Hollywood films.
   Politicians had to find new explanations for juvenile delinquency and
   rock ’n’ roll proved useful.

   A similar social panic centered on the otaku (or NERD) subculture in
   the late 1980s in Japan. Otaku made and swapped amateur manga (comic
   books) some of which were parodies, others featured romances between
   stylized gay men or the adventures of eroticized young girls. In 1989,
   police arrested Tsutomu Miyazaki, a manga and animé enthusiast with a
   taste for softcore porn. When the public learned that Miyazaki had
   abducted, mutilated, and killed four young girls, the entire otaku
   subculture was tainted. One Japanese social anthropologist commented,
   “There are over 100,000 people with the same pastimes as Mr. M.—we have
   a whole standing army of murderers.” Manga shops were raided and owners
   and amateur manga artists arrested and otherwise harassed. Journalists
   fretted that the “Otaku Tribe” was rotting society.

   Such stigmatizing overlooks the fact that NERD culture may just as
   likely provide therapeutic havens as pathological outposts. U.S. NERD
   culture’s origin traces to the science-fiction fan culture that began
   in the mid-1920s. This subculture, which provided a refuge for brainy
   oddballs (mainly men, but some women), and soon included features such
   as fanzines, conventions, and fanciful futuristic costume play, created
   the template for virtually all later youth subcultures. While hardly
   the multicultural ideal later imagined for the crew onboard the
   Starship Enterprise, the early community of fans was welcoming. Ray
   Palmer, a longtime editor of Amazing Stories, and an early organizer of
   NERD culture, was hunchbacked and stood just over four feet tall, but
   was lampooned for his chatty writing style and braggadocio—not his
   disabilities. While not “out” in the 1940s, some of the young devotees
   of science fiction became leaders of the gay-rights movement decades
   later. The speculative, malleable future of science fiction provided
   hope. As with other pulp magazine genres, science fiction also
   encouraged sexist stereotypes, with covers showing buxom women in metal
   bikinis threatened by space octopus. Science-fiction fandom also had
   its dark side. Pulp writer L. Ron Hubbard, with the aid of Astounding
   Science Fiction editor John W. Campbell launched what many consider the
   pathological and others the therapeutic movement of Dianetics, later
   known as Scientology. In his later years, Palmer fell victim to
   theories of Zionist plots for world domination.

   While many benefit from fan communities, some of the farther “geeky”
   outreaches of the online world undoubtedly encourage pathological
   thought. After abandoning the online game World of Warcraft when too
   many hated “jock” types took it up, Rodger found a final haven in the
   Web site puahate.com (this name derived from adding “Hate” to the
   acronym PUA or “pickup artist”), where he could share postings with
   other “incels” (involuntary celibates) who vented their hatred of women
   and of PUA’s who had success with women. This bulletin board likely
   encouraged Rodger’s really frightening ideas about the “degeneracy” of
   women. Rodger concluded his manifesto with statements such as “women
   are like a plague that must be quarantined.” He also offered a “final
   solution” to his cleansing campaign—proposing that all women be rounded
   up in concentration camps and destroyed, except a few to be kept in
   breeding facilities and artificially inseminated.

   Is geek culture to blame for this psychotic vision? If geek culture
   includes puahate.com, then the answer is a qualified yes. Yet, while
   troubled people may be drawn to subcultures like those of early science
   fiction or the otaku culture in 1980s Japan, more participants likely
   benefit from a sense of belonging than those who become delusional and
   violent. These subcultures can provide outlets for bizarre fixations.

   Panics over popular culture mask other insecurities. In the late 1940s
   and early 1950s, when the Comics Code Authority was enacted, parents
   began to wonder if they knew who their children were or who was
   controlling their minds. These worries mirrored the surrounding
   anxieties over communism and who could be trusted. The otaku panic in
   Japan revealed a group of young adults at the height of the Japanese
   Miracle that were not only alienated but alien, not one of “us.” One
   aspect of the trauma inflicted by the recent mass shootings in Isla
   Vista is awareness of a similar social fragmentation. Mass shootings
   end the illusion of unity, the illusion of what individuals are safe
   are “us.”

   Globalism and the digital-communications revolution have allowed
   micro-communities to bloom and the pursuits of happiness to multiply,
   go viral. The idea of an inclusive American identity seems dubious—at
   the moment there are too many channels, and too many perceived enemies,
   making it hard for “we” to find an “us.” In traditional Chinese
   culture, straw dogs were fashioned to serve as burned sacrifices in
   worship. NERD have become, temporarily, a species of straw dog relied
   on in the ceremony to protect our dream of unity.

Why Every Student Should Be A NERD

   By Terry Heick

   As a kid, I never thought of myself as a ' NERD .’

   For one, ' NERD ’ isn’t something you strived to be in the 1980s and
   1990s. (Remember the movie “Revenge of the NERD?)

   I did what was (then) normal stuff–played sports, rode my bike,
   skateboarded, climbed trees, and tried like crazy to avoid doing chores
   or getting grounded. I didn’t enjoy school, and did everything I could
   to keep from reading most of the time. I did play video games, but
   while I never managed to be ‘cool’, that was as dangerously close as I
   got to the social stigma of being branded a NERD. (Probably.)

   But times have changed. A technology-obsessed culture has reinvigorated
   terms like ' NERD ’ and ‘geek’, to several effects. Tech is often
   complex, and is also mainstream. This is a convenient ‘in’ for NERD,
   growing the population of voluntary participants in these longstanding
   sociological genres.

   Put briefly, NERD have historically valued knowing over seeming–ideas
   over conformity, and in the 20-teens, ideas are more valuable than
   ever. Because of technology and that platforms it has enabled, the
   economy is increasingly characterized–to a degree–by people who do
   things rather than corporations that make things. Consumerism hasn’t
   died and manufacturing hasn’t dried up, but the web has democratized
   participation in society–as long as that society is digital.

   ABC, NBC, HBO, Nickelodeon, and other media creators and providers are
   no longer the destination platforms they once were. Today, it’s Netflix
   and Hulu and twitch and perhaps more than any other platform,
   YouTube–and the latter two are dominated by young people making,
   singing, playing, destroying, analyzing, dramatizing, and
   otherwise doing things.

   Stream yourself playing video games as a job? Try explaining that one
   to your parents in the 1980s.

   Be an Instagram celebrity? Maybe just do yoga poses and become a master
   of camera angles and filters and, with an economy of language, become a
   millionaire.

   Film yourself opening packages of high-tech hardware–tablets and
   smartphones. Build a following. Provide content people want or need and
   grow. This, roughly put, is an entirely viable business model in the
   20-teens.

   And is what I do. I help educators think about learning. That’s pretty
   nerdy. I spend a large part of my time on social media but not in a
   cool or personal way–I don’t have the time to do that because I have
   too much else to do. I email. I listen to podcasts and read and read
   some more.

   I talk about ideas, often on a computer, with other people who have
   ideas too. That’s what NERD do.1

   Today, NERD have all of the potential. Following and adhering and
   conforming are currencies less valuable in comparison.

   NERD read. A lot. Often books, but also blogs and social streams. So
   do a lot of people, I guess, but they don’t just read, they read with a
   purpose.

   NERD also gather–reddit, for example, is full of them. They categorize
   themselves into smaller communities called subreddits, and moderate
   themselves out of love for that topic the said subbredit is built
   around.

   NERD do things because they’re fascinated by them.

   NERD seek to counter the mainstream not out of a sense of rebellion,
   but because the mainstream is where good ideas go to die.

   NERD design things. Bridges, avionics, poems, apps, wearable
   technology, media channels, electric cars, and all the other ideas the
   cool kids end up adopting.

   NERD love concepts. They wear t-shirts with ideas on them.

   NERD like games. They gather as adults and play them together–and not
   just athletic games, but board games, video games.

   NERD don’t necessarily love school either, nor do they have to get
   ‘straight A’s.’ That’s not a NERD, that’s a very successful (and
   probably compliant) student. A NERD can get straight A’s, but they do
   so because being successful academically is something they want to do.

   More than anything else, NERD risk ridicule in pursuit of
   realization–of ideas, dreams, and more. As a society we are less and
   less tolerant of bullying, name-calling, and other forms of public
   shaming, which means that calling someone a ' NERD ’ today is less
   acceptable than in the past–which is good.

   But it doesn’t make the following any less true: Now more than ever, if
   you’ve got an idea and have the courage to find your own way–and fail a
   lot along the way–there are the means to do something great with that
   idea.

   Whatever we want to call them, that’s the kind of student education
   would do well to seek to produce.

Joe Rogan explains why " NERD " isn’t an insult

   UFC commentator Joe Rogan revealed why he thinks " NERD " is no longer
   used as an insult during his latest podcast with Lex Fridman.

   Joe Rogan has built a massive following from his popular podcast, the
   Joe Rogan Experience, where he covers a wide range of interesting
   topics.

   During his April 8 episode alongside MIT research scientist, Lex
   Fridman, the pair found themselves in a rather unusual debate,
   discussing if " NERD " is still used as an insult in modern times.
   UnsplashJoe Rogan shared why the perception of being a " NERD " has
   changed in recent years.

   [ad name=”article1″]

   After watching a short clip of Bill Gates making a jump over a chair
   during his show, the podcast host remarked that it was “a pretty good
   jump for a NERD,” which sparked the debate between himself and Fridman.

   Lex revealed his take on the term, expressing that he hated the use of
   it and viewed it as a saying that would often be used to describe
   someone in a negative manner, before asking, “you don’t think of a NERD
   as an ideal of a man?”

   Joe, on the other hand, believed that the days of " NERD " being used as
   an insult had passed, and explained that he would use the word to
   describe someone who had invested a lot of energy into a particular
   subject.

   “There’s nothing wrong with NERD, no I disagree, like I’m a NERD about
   a lot of things,” he replied, pointing towards “dork” as the term that
   is rarely used in a positive light, instead.

   “It’s very rare that dork is positive, whereas NERD is often positive.
   NERD is like a fun way about saying someone is really smart about a
   certain thing,” he explained.

   Joe later admitted that he understood where Lex was coming from, and
   added that the way to dismantle the stereotype would be to introduce a
   positive culture of celebrating those who invest their life in science.
   Joe Rogan, YouTubeMassive stars such as Elon Musk are helping to change
   the perception around those choosing careers in science.

   [ad name=”article3″]

   “I don’t think the way around that is to eliminate words or even stop
   using words, I think the way around it is just to appreciate people
   that are really great at science. The words don’t really matter, it’s
   perceptions that matter and I don’t think science has a bad perception,
   it just doesn’t have a glamorous enough perception,” Joe added.

   One of the main issues the pair highlighted before moving on was the
   fact that " NERD " would often play a part in worsening the perception
   by deciding against activities that didn’t fit the stereotype, such as
   working out or becoming fight fans.

   Although the term " NERD " has not always been associated with
   positivity, many would claim that the perception has changed in recent
   years particularly with tech stars such as Elon Musk inspiring many to
   appreciate the work of those in similar fields.

   By Adam Bradley
   Published March 24, 2021Updated June 28, 2021

   OMAR HOLMON WAS in high school when his mother sat him down for the
   talk. “I thought we were having the talk about being Black in America,”
   he recalls. “Oh, no. You already know all that,” she told him. “I’m
   talking about you being such a big NERD!” In Holmon’s room, in the
   dresser drawers where his clothes should have been, he kept
   sequentially ordered issues of Daredevil and Green Lantern comics. He
   watched “Daria” and “Samurai Jack.” He played Mario Kart. This was in
   Hackensack, N.J., in the early 2000s. Omar’s mother feared her son
   might never find a date.

   Two decades later, Holmon, now 36 and based in Brooklyn, is happily
   married and the co-founder, along with William Evans, 41, of the
   website Black NERD Problems. Their book of the same title will be
   published this summer. Both projects excavate the territory of NERD
   culture — comics, anime, e-sports, tabletop gaming, science fiction,
   fantasy and more — from a Black perspective that the broader NERD
   community has historically overlooked or, worse still, outright
   attacked.

   The pair are part of a new generation of Black NERD (or “Blerds,” as
   it is sometimes styled, a portmanteau of “Black” and " NERD "): critics
   and creators, scholars and social influencers, artists and activists
   who are shifting the culture in the years following the election of
   Barack Obama, America’s first Black and Blerd president, by centering
   unexpected stories of Black characters. Jordan Peele, a self-proclaimed
   Blerd, has lately exercised his influence, built by advancing the
   horror genre in film through “Get Out” (2017) and “Us” (2019), and with
   his reimagining of the classic sci-fi television series “The Twilight
   Zone” (2019-20). The director Ava DuVernay is also delving into science
   fiction and fantasy, adapting both Octavia E. Butler’s novel “Dawn”
   (1997) and DC Comics’ “New Gods” (1971) for the screen. Marvel Comics
   has in recent years embraced Black characters — witness the forthcoming
   Disney+ series “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,” starring Anthony
   Mackie as Falcon — as well as Black creators like the director Ryan
   Coogler, who is working on a new Wakanda series and a sequel to “Black
   Panther” (2018), which is scheduled to be released next year. Newly
   visible in part due to the remarkable commercial success of that
   franchise, as well as to critically acclaimed television series like
   HBO’s “Watchmen” (2019) and “Lovecraft Country” (2020), the Blerd
   moment seems to have only just begun.

   But being Black and nerdy hasn’t always been so glamorous. Black comic
   book fans report suspicious white store owners trailing them in shops.
   At Comic-Cons, Black cosplayers are sometimes chastised by officious
   gatekeepers, told that their chosen characters aren’t supposed to be
   Black. More ominously, Black gamers hear the N-word hurled casually
   during online sessions and sometimes find themselves targeted for
   attack when revealed or presumed to be Black. In addition to these
   outside pressures, many Black fans of fantasy, science fiction and
   other genres erroneously coded as white spaces face ridicule from Black
   friends and family members who see what they do as “acting white.”

   The tension is this: Black NERD unsettle the myth of a monolithic
   Blackness. In an American imagination that has historically stereotyped
   Black people as alternately ignorant and emotional or sexualized and
   cool, the NERD — smart and cerebral, unsexy and decidedly uncool —
   creates cognitive dissonance. Not only do Black NERD confound racist
   stereotypes, they also pierce the protective orthodoxy of Blackness
   passed down in the United States across generations. Under slavery and
   Jim Crow, Black people maintaining — or at least projecting — unity
   proved a necessary protective practice. Strength came in numbers, as
   did political influence and economic clout. What would happen if we all
   announced publicly that we were going to start doing our own human
   thing without regard to the group? Few considered it worth the risk to
   find out.

   But who in 2021 benefits from thinking of Black people as just one
   thing? Certainly not Black individuals, who, like all individuals, are
   complex amalgams of shifting affinities, of inherited and chosen
   identities. And certainly not Black NERD, whose very existence is
   often rendered invisible because they present an inconvenient
   complication to a straightforward story of Blackness in America.

   SAY THE WORD " NERD " and it conjures Coke-bottle glasses and pocket
   protectors, the kind worn by the studious and socially awkward white
   guys (and they are nearly always white and nearly always guys) bullied
   in 1980s cult classic films: think Robert Carradine’s Lewis Skolnick
   from “Revenge of the NERD "  (1984) and Crispin Glover’s George McFly
   from “Back to the Future” (1985). This is NERD 1.0. The NERD 1.0
   archetype has its variants, perhaps the most prominent being the East
   Asian NERD (the flip side to the stereotypical martial-arts action
   hero), portrayed with model-minority bookishness, either sexless or
   sex-crazed, like Gedde Watanabe’s Long Duk Dong from “Sixteen Candles”
   (1984). Though NERD 1.0 might seem easy to dismiss as an all in good
   fun comic figure, its influence has lingered in the typecasting faced
   by both East Asian and South Asian actors to this day. But over the
   decades, the term " NERD " has undergone a dramatic evolution — some
   would call it a corruption. Once the defiant moniker of the brainy
   social outcast, NERD is now claimed by anyone with a deep affinity for
   some area of knowledge. Call it NERD 2.0. Sneakerheads are NERD now,
   obsessing over tooling and the vicissitudes of the secondary sales
   market. So are cannabis connoisseurs, with encyclopedic knowledge of
   different strains and the legal highs they produce. " NERD is not an
   othering anymore; it’s a spectrum,” Holmon says.

   The most famous fictional Black NERD, Steve Urkel, portrayed for nine
   seasons starting in 1989 by the actor Jaleel White on the sitcom
   “Family Matters,” is decidedly NERD 1.0. He wears high-water pants with
   suspenders; his enormous eyeglasses are secured to his head by a strap.
   Clumsy and irrepressible, his running gag relies on him disrupting the
   lives of his neighbors, the Winslow family, then uttering his
   high-pitched, nasal catchphrase, “Did I do that?” Urkel is equal parts
   exhausting and endearing, which explains how he went from a supporting
   character to the star of the show. Reprise his role in 2021, however,
   and you’d likely fill it with a NERD 2.0: perhaps a young Questlove,
   the polymathic drummer of the Roots, or a teenage Daveed Diggs, the
   Grammy and Tony Award-winning actor and recording artist who now has a
   recurring role as an Urkelian interloper on the family sitcom
   “Black-ish.”

   “This work is a meditation on the stylistic attributes that have become
   emblematic in NERD fashion,” says the Brooklyn-based artist Troy
   Michie, who made this original collage for T. “Using the character of
   Steve Urkel as a reference, the work starts to unfold, complicating the
   confines of a singular identity.”Credit...Troy Michie, “Did I Do That”
   (2020)

   Better yet, think of Issa Rae, the 36-year-old actress, writer and
   producer behind the hit HBO series “Insecure,” whose fifth and final
   season will air later this year. The protagonist, Issa — Rae shares a
   name with her character — seems like a Blerd avatar: a Stanford
   graduate working at a nonprofit in her hometown of Los Angeles who is
   at once awkward, quirky and cool. However, when asked by a journalist
   from The Atlantic in 2018 if she saw her character as the natural Blerd
   evolution from Urkel, Rae pushed back. “I never identified my character
   as nerdy, because the classic cultural NERD — the gamer, the ‘Star
   Wars’ or sci-fi or ‘Lord of the Rings’ geek — just never interested
   me,” she said. Instead, she sought to explore the “in-between” of Black
   characters — the complexity and peculiarity often denied by the
   polarized perspective on Black people as cool or corny. Rae’s
   reluctance to accept the Blerd designation for herself or her character
   doesn’t stop Blerds from embracing her and her show: “I don’t know if
   she realizes that she made such an impact on Black girls who call
   themselves NERD,” says Jamie Broadnax, 40, the Virginia Beach-based
   founder of the online community Black Girl NERD.

   NERD are the cool kids now, and it’s not because they’ve changed all
   that much; after all, a big part of being a NERD is a stubborn
   insistence on the eccentricities of one’s passions and personality.
   Rather, cool itself has changed. In an increasingly fragmented media
   landscape, monastic dedication to a narrow interest is no longer
   stigmatized. Communities build up around affinities, connecting people
   through social media platforms that foster the rapid exchange of ideas
   — or, more succinctly put, are conducive to nerding out. Coolness also
   follows power, and great power now rests in sectors of society,
   particularly in technology, where NERD have traditionally thrived.

   " NERD hold the keys to the castle,” says Terril “Rell” Fields, the
   33-year-old founder of the Raleigh, N.C.-based blerd.com. Growing up,
   Fields was “almost stereotypically nerdy.” Before he got contact lenses
   for sports, he wore huge glasses with one lens thicker than the other
   to correct the vision in his weaker eye. “And I was at the lunch table
   with the kids playing Magic: The Gathering, which did not help at all,”
   he says with a laugh. When he launched blerd.com in 2019, after
   assembling a team of fellow Blerds, it marked a culmination of
   thousands of hours spent gaming, flipping through comic books and
   watching anime. “Blerds still love the same types of content [as other
   NERD],” he says. “A Blerd just sees NERD culture through their Black
   cultural lens.” They may notice things that other NERD don’t: a Black
   or brown supporting character in a comic book that might otherwise be
   forgotten; a political allegory of race and democracy played out in a
   sci-fi television series.

   When it comes to finding distinct points of entry into NERD culture,
   Blerds are not alone. Disability, long a theme in these realms —
   whether through Professor Charles Xavier and his X-Men or
   neurodiversity in science fiction — is also a defining facet of the new
   NERD culture, with fans pushing for accessibility in gaming and greater
   inclusion at Comic-Cons. Queer and trans NERD are also increasingly
   visible and, along racial lines, Indiginerds claim space, as do Latina
   and Asian subsets of the universe. Bao Phi, who grew up a
   self-described “Vietnamese ghetto refugee NERD "  in Minnesota’s Twin
   Cities, wrote a column in 2010 for the Star Tribune that inspired the
   website thenerdsofcolor.org, which now brings together a cross-racial
   coalition.

   But for many of the Black NERD coming of age in the past two decades,
   the term “Blerd” was a lifeline. It cast a protective spell, offering a
   covert way for Black fans to connect and communicate in spaces that
   were often hostile to their presence. “Most of us calling ourselves
   Blerds were simply trying to find each other,” explains Karama Horne,
   the Brooklyn-based founder of a website called theblerdgurl. Before the
   advent of Twitter in 2006 and Instagram in 2010, Horne frequented
   message boards and other virtual spaces where she often witnessed women
   and people of color being bullied. Once the word “Blerd” gained
   currency, it was possible to support one another against racist and
   sexist trolls. Ultimately, the word came to define a movement, one that
   was hiding all along in plain sight.

   A BRIEF HISTORY of Black NERD dates back to before the Revolutionary
   War, to Phillis Wheatley, the young Black woman born a slave who was
   the first person of African descent to publish a collection of English
   poetry — only to have to prove her authorship, as well as her knowledge
   of the works of Homer, Ovid and Virgil, to a panel of “the most
   respectable characters in Boston,” as the 18 white men described
   themselves in a note “To the Public” that introduces her “Poems on
   Various Subjects, Religious and Moral” (1773). The Black NERD also
   lives in the pages of Charles W. Chesnutt, whose short-story collection
   “The Conjure Woman” (1899) reads like a late 19th-century iteration of
   Peele’s “Get Out,” where the resources of the Black imagination
   overcome the sunken place of white mythmaking and domination. And it
   lives in Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man” (1952), whose nameless Black
   male protagonist is a self-described “thinker-tinker” writing the story
   of his life from his underground lair fitted with precisely 1,369 light
   bulbs; even the novel’s title evokes H.G. Wells’s science fiction
   classic “The Invisible Man” (1897), repurposing invisibility as a
   metaphor for the erasure of Black identity under the racist white gaze.

   Back in the 1980s in Mobile, Ala., two cousins — a boy and a girl —
   spent hours together conjuring imagined worlds. He loved comic books;
   the Incredible Hulk series was his favorite because, though the boy
   could never be white like Bruce Banner, he could perhaps turn green
   like the Hulk. She loved science fiction; Tanith Lee and C.S. Friedman
   enchanted her, as did Octavia E. Butler, who was Black like her. Fast
   forward half their lifetimes and the boy, now a 48-year-old man, the
   stand-up comic and political commentator W. Kamau Bell, has won three
   consecutive Emmys for CNN’s “The United Shades of America.” The girl,
   now a 48-year-old woman, the novelist N.K. Jemisin, has won three
   consecutive Hugo Awards for the novels in her Broken Earth trilogy. “I
   get goose bumps thinking about it,” Bell says. “The two of us in my
   grandmother’s house as kids laying on the floor, her writing and me
   drawing and ultimately clinging together because we didn’t feel like we
   fit in.” That sense is common to Black NERD, particularly among those
   who grew up before there was a name to call themselves. “I was in my
   30s before I heard the word ‘Blerd.’ And I thought, ‘That would have
   been helpful when I was 12,’” Bell says. According to him, it’s about
   “planting a flag.” Blerd stakes a claim for the free and full exercise
   of Black individuality within the space of a collective identity.

   It’s no coincidence that Black creative voices have asserted themselves
   so powerfully at a time when Black suffering and death have dominated
   the news: Eric Garner, Elijah McClain, Derrick Scott and George Floyd
   all cried out “I can’t breathe” before they were killed at the hands of
   law enforcement. The phrase became a rallying cry for Black Lives
   Matter activists. Bell hears within those desperate words a call to
   action for artists, as well. His cousin’s novels, set on distant
   planets, peopled by beings whose names sound foreign on the tongue, are
   more than escapist fantasies. “This sort of individualist art creates
   more space for Black people to breathe,” Bell says. “It creates more
   space for us to relax and be ourselves. [Then] we can actually stand up
   and fight when we need to fight.”

   Art and activism have often accompanied each other in Black American
   life. “Every revolution, every evolution, has some type of aesthetic
   sister or brother movement,” says the artist John Jennings, 50, a
   professor of media and cultural studies at the University of
   California, Riverside, who has illustrated Damian Duffy’s graphic novel
   adaptations of Butler’s “Parable of the Sower” (2020) and “Kindred”
   (2017), and in 2015 drew the cover for a lauded collection, “Octavia’s
   Brood: Science Fiction Stories From Social Justice Movements,” in which
   artist-activists explore how fantasy is also a resource for political
   change. In the foreword, the book’s co-editors, Walidah Imarisha and
   Adrienne Maree Brown, issue a call to action: ﻿“We believe it is our
   right and responsibility to write ourselves into the future.”

   “The idea of a Black future is still a radical notion,” Jennings says.
   “Think about it: Before ‘Star Trek,’ the only time you would see Black
   folk or people of color in the future — well, you wouldn’t. ... Were we
   murdered? Were we dropped in the ocean? We don’t even know.”
   Afrofuturism uses literature and the graphic arts, music and dance,
   film and television to imagine Black people into a future long denied
   them. These recuperative acts are about more than entertainment, though
   they must also be entertaining; they argue that even imagined futures
   must take stock of the past. In these Afrofuturist stories, the most
   inconceivable plot points aren’t invented — time-traveling portals and
   Rorschach masks — but real. Both “Watchmen” and “Lovecraft Country”
   revisit the searing trauma of the 1921 Tulsa Massacre, in which white
   mobs killed hundreds of Black fellow citizens and burned the thriving
   Greenwood district in Oklahoma to the ground. In doing so, both series
   circumvent linear time, opening up new mechanisms for confronting a
   tortured inheritance. “A lot of times, we are dragging our pain with us
   into the future,” Jennings says. By depicting this historical atrocity
   and recasting it within a salvific Black narrative, with Black heroes
   ready to fight, these stories offer a way, much like the blues, to
   transcend pain not by evading it but by making it into art.

   The New Negro Movement of the 1920s, spearheaded in part by W.E.B. Du
   Bois, the political philosopher and tactician (and author of a 1920
   sci-fi story, “The Comet”), had the Harlem Renaissance. The Black Power
   Movement of the late 1960s and the 1970s had the Black Arts Movement.
   It should come as no surprise that the emergent political insurgency is
   taking shape at a time when artists are increasingly drawn to
   speculative fiction and fantasy, horror and weird fiction as a
   necessary respite from the unrelenting pressure of combating white
   supremacy, and as a creative resource for addressing present-day
   challenges. In an era in which the notion of fact itself is unmoored,
   and space lasers are not the stuff of comic books but of hateful
   conspiracy theories, sci-fi and fantasy might just provide the
   necessary distance from our present conflicts to reimagine a shared set
   of norms and values — not yet here, but in a galaxy far, far away.
   “There’s nothing wrong with escapism, and there’s nothing wrong with
   using science fiction and fantasy as self-care,” says Horne of
   theblerdgurl. “Having moments of happiness and joy in between pain.
   That’s us. That’s part of our culture.”

   MICA BURTON IS a NERD renaissance woman: an e-sports host, cosplay
   model, anime aficionado and Dungeons & Dragons player. She’s also
   fluent in Elvish, a constructed language J.R.R. Tolkien introduced in
   his “Middle-earth” books, which she put on display earlier this year
   during her appearance on Narrative Telephone, a web series developed
   during the pandemic by a collective of gamers called Critical Role.
   Officially launched in 2015 by Matthew Mercer, Critical Role
   livestreams D&D games via the video platform Twitch; YouTube episodes
   have garnered over 288 million views.

   Burton, 26 and based in Los Angeles, is not a Blerd, she tells me, but
   a NERD who happens to be Black. “I’m not trying to assimilate,
   necessarily, but I’m trying to exist in space without purposefully
   stating that I’m different,” she explains. This resistance to the Blerd
   moniker is suggestive of a generational divide, even among those at
   opposite ends of the millennial band. “I meet a lot of people who are
   in their 20s and younger who don’t like the term,” Horne says. “They
   say, ‘I don’t understand why we have to call ourselves something
   different. Why can’t you just be a NERD?’ I laugh because I’m like,
   ‘I’m so happy that you feel that there are so many of us that we don’t
   have to say it anymore.’” Blerd or NERD, the challenge is the same: to
   be at home in the worlds of one’s choosing. “My entire purpose of my
   career is to be the representation I didn’t have as a kid,” Burton
   says.

   When Burton was a kid, her NERD tendencies were fostered by a
   supportive family. By elementary school, she and her father were
   playing video games together, sharing a passion for fantasy and
   fighting games. “We played Halo together and I kicked his ass,” she
   says. “It’s how fathers and daughters work.” Mica Burton’s father is
   LeVar Burton, who as Kunta Kinte on “Roots” (1977), Lieutenant
   Commander Geordi La Forge on “Star Trek: The Next Generation” in the
   late ’80s and early ’90s and the host of PBS’s long-running children’s
   series “Reading Rainbow” is something like the patron saint of Black
   NERD. Early on, though, Mica set out on her own path. “She’s always
   been a ‘Star Wars’ fan over ‘Star Trek,’” says LeVar, 64 and also based
   in Los Angeles. That stubborn streak has served her well as she’s
   pushed to clear a path for NERD like herself — a self-identified cis
   female Black bisexual — in spaces that sometimes don’t know what to do
   with her or, worse still, are actively hostile to her presence. “I
   can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to bring it up to people: ‘Hey,
   if I’m gonna be on your livestream, do you have moderation that blocks
   the N-word? Because that’s gonna happen,’” she says.

   Her father knows the challenge of fitting his Blackness in to places
   where it isn’t always welcome. Even on “Reading Rainbow,” which he
   began hosting in 1983 when he was the age his daughter is now, he had
   to fight to retain the markers of his identity: his earring, his
   changing hairstyles, the things that defined his young Black manhood.
   “It’s a part of who I am,” he told the producers at the time. “If you
   want me to do this show, then you’ve gotta take all of me.” They
   conceded.

   These dogged acts of representation, of taking his effortless Black
   cool to places where it might be least expected, are part of what makes
   LeVar an enduring presence in American culture. Today, his podcast,
   “LeVar Burton Reads,” lends his voice to both pioneering and emerging
   authors of Black sci-fi and fantasy, from Samuel R. Delany and Nalo
   Hopkinson to Nnedi Okorafor and Suyi Davies Okungbowa. “It was really
   my love of science fiction that put me squarely in the category [of
   Black NERD], even at a young age,” LeVar says. “For a young Black kid
   growing up in Sacramento in the late ’60s, it was preferable to imagine
   other worlds and other ways of existing that did not involve racial
   prejudice.” Like any other sci-fi fan, he was drawn to exciting stories
   of far-flung galaxies; he was also driven by the urgent promise of a
   future where he might someday be free within himself.

   Watching Gene Roddenberry’s “Star Trek” in the 1960s, LeVar discovered
   a world more civil and sane than the one he witnessed one station down
   the dial, where news reports showed footage of Black people assaulted
   with fire hoses and attacked by police dogs. In Nichelle Nichols’s
   portrayal of Lieutenant Nyota Uhura, he and other Black viewers could
   see themselves as part of a future that seemed far from promised in the
   present. Uhura represented the first phase of advancement in Black NERD
   culture: representation. That representation is particularly profound
   for Black women. “Uhura is my spirit character: a Black woman at the
   back of a room full of white guys who has to listen and translate
   everything,” Horne says. “Nobody thinks about what Uhura does. She
   spoke every language in the universe. That’s Black women!”

   Black women continue to act as translators today, helping to bring
   Blerd culture into the mainstream. You can see this in politics. Stacey
   Abrams is an avowed Trekkie, and the Massachusetts congresswoman Ayanna
   Pressley is described by her friend Aisha Francis, the scholar and
   activist, as the consummate Blerd. You can see it in music. Lizzo, who
   plays the flute, was a proud band NERD in high school and used that
   outsider energy to define her distinctive, chart-topping style. And
   Janelle Monáe once joined Chester French on a 2009 song called " NERD
   Girl,” on which she sings, “I’m your NERD girl / Reading comics in the
   dark / My favorite station’s NPR.” Now she’s the inspiration for
   Jemisin’s heroine Sojourner “Jo” Mullein in the “Far Sector”
   (2019-present) comic book series, which reimagines the universe of DC’s
   Green Lantern.

   You can see Black women NERD’ influence most especially on television.
   Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson, the podcasting duo behind “2 Dope
   Queens,” dedicated an episode of their 2018 HBO live performances to
   the topic of Blerds. “What are you nerdy about?” Williams asks one of
   their guests, the actress Uzo Aduba, who responds with a rhapsodic
   reverie on Ms. Pac-Man and Mortal Kombat. With “Lovecraft Country,” the
   showrunner Misha Green created a Blerd extravaganza, drawing on a
   predominantly Black cast to imagine a fantasy world still in touch with
   our own. These Black women creators represent the next phase in the
   evolution of Black NERD culture, advancing past representation alone to
   creative ownership. “It’s got to be more than putting a face on the
   screen, it’s got to be authority,” says Broadnax of Black Girl NERD.
   “Black people being in positions of power.”

   This inflection point, of Black people in power both in front of and
   behind the camera, arrived just three years ago. “When it comes to
   Blerd culture, you have before ‘Black Panther’ and after ‘Black
   Panther,’” Jennings, the illustrator, says. The power of the film was
   partly symbolic — the fact of seeing a Black superhero was inspiring
   for a generation of Black viewers who previously had to imaginatively
   project themselves onto white protagonists or subsist on secondary
   characters. Less visible but perhaps more consequential, the film was
   the vision and product of a largely Black team of creators, led by
   Coogler. “If there wasn’t a ‘Black Panther,’ we would not have had a
   ‘Watchmen’; if there wasn’t a ‘Watchmen,’ they would have never given a
   Black woman millions of dollars to create the HBO show that was
   ‘Lovecraft Country,’” Horne explains. These successful works of public
   art and entertainment are matters of personal consequence for NERD —
   and Black NERD in particular — who suddenly find their passions
   vindicated. As Horne puts it, “I wasn’t considered mainstream until
   2018.”

   The triumph of “Black Panther” helps explain the ascendancy of Black
   NERD today. The film created an opportunity for undercover Blerds to
   test out their nerdish tendencies in public. Mica Burton witnessed “the
   feeling of safety among Black people to say, ‘I read comic books. I
   watch anime. I like Marvel films,’” she says. If your friends were cool
   with you doing the Wakanda salute, then maybe you could slip in that
   you still collect Pokémon cards. After 2018, she adds, “we saw a huge
   uprising of a lot more accounts of Black people on Twitter saying, ‘I
   like these things!’ and then other people going, ‘I do, too!’ And
   that’s how communities are formed.”

   THE FUTURE OF Black NERD is the future of the retro: a return to the
   timeworn techniques of storytelling. In a graphic novel or a video
   game, a Netflix series or a role-playing campaign, you can take things
   for granted — like racial and ethnic diversity, like equality along the
   spectra of gender and sexual orientation — that the world beyond is
   somehow still deliberating. These nerdish things offer freedom for
   self-fashioning that has historically been denied to Black Americans by
   a racist imaginary that insisted on projecting Black people in ways
   that served white supremacist fantasy and power. Black NERD culture
   rejects the grotesque menagerie of racist stereotypes, as well as the
   compensatory images of Black cool, by insisting on the full and
   sometimes messy exercise of human agency. It gives license to be Black
   and awkward, Black and brainy, Black and free.

   For Black Americans, exercising the freedom to imagine has always been
   a radical act, even a dangerous one. “Black Panther” and “Insecure” and
   “Lovecraft Country” prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Black stories
   can have wide appeal among all audiences — and specifically among white
   audiences. This is not only a commercial matter but a creative one:
   Black audiences have long had to project themselves into white stories.
   Whiteness was the default, and Black stories were thought to be
   compelling only to Black people themselves, or to white audiences
   seeking a voyeuristic glimpse into an unknown territory. What’s
   happening now is something different: the ordinary, everyday capacity
   of assuming that the particulars of Black lives can — and must — be
   understood as universal, too.

   At the end of “Invisible Man,” Ellison’s nameless protagonist asks a
   bold question: “And it is this which frightens me: Who knows but that,
   on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?” In 1952, a young Black
   author giving voice to a young Black protagonist claiming that he might
   speak for you — whomever you may be — was indeed a wild fantasy. Nearly
   70 years later, Black NERD, Blerds and dreamers everywhere are doing
   the same: daring to speak for a culture that needs their voices now
   more than ever.

Revenge of the NERD: Being Popular in High School Doesn't Make You Rich,
After All

   Last year, a study found that extra friends in high school translated
   into extra pay in middle age. But new research says otherwise.

   Mathletes, goth freaks, drama NERD: you've been vindicated.

   Last year, awkward teens everywhere got a rather depressing dose of
   news when new research suggested that kids who were popular in high
   school also tended to end up richer than their classmates later in
   life. "Economics Says Revenge of the NERD Is a Lie," declared our
   friends at The Atlantic Wire. "Sorry NERD: popular kids earn more in
   the long run," mocked Wonkblog.

   As a registered high school NERD -- and I used to compete in both chess
   and Magic the Gathering™ tournaments, meaning I'm actually registered
   somewhere -- this study naturally bugged the hell out of me. So I
   couldn't help but feel a little glee upon discovering that Jason
   Fletcher, a professor at Yale's School of Public Health who has studied
   the way teenage depression and ADHD impact future earnings, had
   released a draft paper this week suggesting that, no, being well-liked
   in 12th grade does not in fact make you wealthier in middle age.

   There were already a few reasons to take last year's study with a grain
   of salt. To begin, the paper used data on men who graduated from
   Wisconsin high schools in 1957. During a telephone interview in 1975,
   the subjects were asked to name their three best male friends from
   senior year. So we're talking about a paper that hinged on the
   quarter-century-old recollections of middle-aged, mostly white guys who
   grew up in the Eisenhower era.

   But hey, good studies that track their subjects over decades are hard
   to come by, and academics work with the data they have. The research
   team counted up how many times each of their Wisconsin men was
   "nominated" as somebody's best bud, then looked at their pay decades
   later. And, as noted, the popular kids tended to make out best. Each
   nomination was worth roughly a 2 percent earnings increase 35 years on,
   equivalent to nearly half the boost that comes from finishing an extra
   year of school. "We estimate that moving from the 20th to 80th
   percentile of the high-school popularity distribution yields a 10
   percent wage premium nearly 40 years later," the paper noted. In the
   end, the authors suggested that the social skills required to make a
   friends at age 18 might simply have been useful in the adult workplace.
   Not inconceivable, but certainly discouraging for those who had trouble
   finding a lunch table.

   Enter Fletcher. Instead of looking at Silent Generation men from the
   Midwest, he pulled data from a 13-year study that began tracking
   thousands of male and female adolescents from across the country in
   1994. The survey asked students to name up to ten friends instead of
   three, which gave a somewhat more complete set of data to work with.

   It turned out there were similarities between the findings. Just like
   the Wisconsin study, each friendship nomination translated into 2
   percent higher wages come age 30. But here was the big difference: the
   new data set not only allowed Fletcher to compare the effects of
   popularity between peers over time, but also between thousands of
   siblings. Social scientists like to compare siblings when possible,
   because by tracking people from the exact same family background, it
   lets them to try figure out what other factors might be influencing
   their life trajectories. And in this case, it led to an interesting
   result. Even if one sibling was better liked at school, they weren't
   any more likely to out-earn their brother or sister. The impact of
   popularity on future pay simply vanished.

   Fletcher argued that this was a sign that the real driving force behind
   income among the study's subjects was probably family background, not
   your ability to make friends as an adolescent.

   Now a few quick but crucial notes about both these studies. Headlines
   aside, neither of them is actually measuring popularity in the Mean
   Girls sense of the word. Rather, they're really measuring if students
   are well liked, whether they're the most popular girl on the
   cheerleading squad, the starting quarterback, or the nicest geek on
   model U.N. Moreover, the papers don't appear completely incompatible:
   the Wisconsin, study, for instance found "a positive association
   between a warm early family environment" and popularity in high school.
   So a caring family translated into friends at school which translated
   into a payday at work. That seems at least somewhat in keeping with
   Fletcher's new paper, which simply does more to control for the effects
   of how students were raised.

   But in any event, it seems there's hope, if not revenge, for us NERD
   yet.

   My son is halfway through his freshman year at college and is trying to
   decide on a major. He asked me over Christmas break for some advice. To
   me, it’s an easy choice. “Be a NERD,” I told him. “Be a NERD.”

   Satya Nadella was named CEO of Microsoft last week. Nadella has an
   undergraduate degree in engineering and master’s degrees in both
   computer sciences and business. Before joining Microsoft he worked as a
   member of the technology staff at Sun Microsystems. At Microsoft he was
   previously the President of their server and tools division, a senior
   VP of research and development at the online service division and an
   executive VP of their cloud and enterprise group.

   In other words, he’s a NERD. Oh, and did I mention he’s also a big fan
   of cricket? Definitely a NERD. And now he’s the CEO of Microsoft. Of
   all the people in the world, Microsoft chose a NERD to be its boss.

   Star Trek Magazine Poster Book, Voyage Three, Star Date 7611.01 (1976)

   Nadella joins a long list of NERD running technology companies, big
   and small. People like Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and Larry Page. Dick
   Costolo, the CEO of Twitter graduated with degrees in computer and
   communication sciences before trying out his hand at comedy, a very
   NERD-like thing to do. Yahoo's Marissa Mayer graduated Stanford with a
   B.S. in symbolic systems (what the hell is that?) and an M.S. in
   computer science where her specialization was in artificial
   intelligence. And if that isn’t nerdy enough, Mayer reportedly dated
   Larry Page at one time.

   Amazon’s Jeff Bezos attended Princeton University and graduated with a
   B.S. in Engineering, specializing in electrical engineering and
   computer science. Oh, and while he was at Princeton, he also served as
   the President of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the
   Exploration and Development of Space. Now that’s some scary NERD stuff.
   And don’t believe for a minute that Larry Ellison, the manly-man CEO at
   Oracle isn’t a NERD – the guy was a computer design specialist, even
   though he never graduated from college.

   The list goes on and on. There are exceptions of course. HP’s Meg
   Whitman, for example, grew up in the world of marketing and brand
   management. Steve Ballmer took the business route too. But for the most
   part it’s the NERD who rule technology companies. Scientists.
   Engineers. Biologists. And if they have a little bit of business sense
   then all the better.

   Because here’s the truth: business is not that tough to learn. I know
   this because I’m running a profitable little business and I’m not
   1/1000 as smart as any of the people I’ve mentioned above. You buy low
   and you sell higher. You keep your overhead under control. You figure
   out a simple return on investment. You don’t put all your eggs in one
   basket. The typical marketing, accounting or management degree that
   takes the average student four years to complete at state college would
   take a smart NERD half the amount of time. It’s just math. In fact, for
   the most part business is pretty simple math. Especially when you
   compare it to the math and logic the NERD do in their engineering,
   physics and computer science programs.

   If you run a technology company you will do better if you are a NERD.
   If you are investing in a technology company you will have more chance
   of success if a NERD is leading it. I recently asked Sean Flynn, a
   partner at Shasta Ventures about Swipely, one of their investments.

   Swipely, named by Forbes as "One of America's Most Promising Companies"
   is aiming to enable local merchants to inexpensively capture and
   analyze data in a way once reserved only for big businesses. The Rhode
   Island company is run by Angus Davis, an already successful
   entrepreneur who holds seven (issued and pending) patents and who
   worked his way up in the world developing websites and products for
   companies like Netscape. I’ve never met or spoken to Davis, but he also
   seems kind of nerdy to me. And Flynn loves that.  “It’s not just the
   idea for a company,” Flynn told me. “It’s the person running the
   company. We love Angus and that’s why we invested.” Another victory for
   another NERD.

   Successful technology companies are generally run by NERD. I could
   argue that NERD, being more technical, also have more vision and
   relevance in a more technical world. And that is true. But more
   importantly if you are a NERD running a company than you will be
   respected by the other NERD who just want to do nerdy things and are
   happy to let you be the boss because you’re a NERD like them. You will
   be able to speak their language and understand their problems. You will
   know better how to manage their time and create expectations. You can
   talk about Star Trek and Comic-Con and pick apart Myth Busters.

   You can always hire business people to do your accounting and finance.
   You can always find salesmen to sell your products (and those NERD
   with a smidgen of communication skills excel better there too). People
   who get technical degrees in college and can develop the skills to
   socialize, speak to groups and better understand other people are the
   ones who often emerge as leaders of tech companies. Of course, they
   will always be NERD at heart. Just ask Nadella. Cricket? Ugh.

   Adam J. Ruben strikes a wacky pose atop a fiberglass lion at a mini
   golf course in 1990.

   Adam J. Ruben, a comedian, writer and scientist, has been called a NERD
   for most of his life. Does he fit the bill? Probably.

   He was in the Princeton marching band. He clearly had no qualms about
   wearing suspenders in 1990. He kept an audio diary in seventh grade.
   And today he’s taking his one-man show, “Don’t Beat Me Up: Stories and
   Artifacts from Adolescence” to his high school alma mater, performing
   for the freshmen class while the sophomores and juniors take the PSAT.

   It’s a spoken word performance based off of diaries, poems and other
   documentation of his grade school life as the object of so many
   bullies’ attention.

   The show started out as an act of commiseration with peers, fashioned
   primarily as a comedy. “Most of it is joking about how lame we all were
   and how nerdy we were and looking at it now from this side,” Ruben
   said. But it does expose the pain of growing up in America as a NERD.

   “I don’t think any of the NERD at my school had that one day where
   they stood up to the bully and the bully backed down, like that scene
   in ‘The Christmas Story’ where Ralphie Parker stands up to Scut Farkus
   and starts wailing on him,” Ruben said.

   For Ruben, bullying was something that happened so often he couldn’t go
   to school without being bullied.

   All the advice about dealing with bullying that he was given as a child
   – Kill the bully with kindness because nobody’s been nice to them
   before; If you’re nice to a bully then suddenly they’ll be a gentle
   giant on your side; Make the bully laugh; Ignore the bully, walk away;
   Just be yourself – was never anything that worked, he said.

   “It just isn’t true, and kids realize it isn’t true,” Ruben said. “It’s
   good advice for adults, but for kids ‘be yourself’ doesn’t really
   work.”

   “I end (my show) with sort of a non-conclusion. That it does get better
   when you become an adult. People sort of stop being petty and selfish
   about it, and the bullying really changes character and goes away
   often. But what would I tell an eighth-grader today who’s being bullied
   other than it gets better eventually? I don’t have a good answer.”

   But an interesting meeting at the Wilmington Fringe Festival caught
   Ruben’s attention. A high school student came up to him after the show
   and said, “Yeah, all the advice that you said doesn’t work about
   bullying, they just had an assembly with us and told us all the same
   advice,” Ruben said. “Which is interesting and sad.”

   With so much media attention on America’s culture of bullying and
   tragic tributes to victims of bullying who took their own lives rather
   than continue to be abused by their peers, Ruben sees the ongoing
   acceptance of bullying to be infuriating. Especially so, he said,
   because no good solution to the problem has been found.

   “Society has this expectation that NERD are people to be bullied and
   made fun of,” Ruben said. “I would get mad every time there was a TV
   show that had NERD characters on it and they always had thick glasses
   with tape in the middle and they were in the chess club, and it became
   perfectly OK to make fun of them.

   “It made me very angry because being a NERD was not something that I
   chose, and it was not something that I was proud of, and it was not
   something I could change,” he said.

   The social pressures of being bullied makes NERD turn on one another,
   he said.

   “It’s that need to feel like no matter what, you’re not the very, very
   bottom person. There is someone that you can still be more popular
   than. One kid who is weirder than you, and you make sure that kid is
   your friend because then you don’t look so bad in comparison,” he said.

   “I knew, in high school, I could identify the few kids that I thought
   were less popular than I was. And it sounds horrible. I think that it
   made me feel a little good that no matter what, I was third to last and
   not last.”

   “Don’t Beat Me Up” showcases some of those painful moments in Ruben’s
   life. Like the note he typed on homecoming night in 10th grade.

   “I promised myself that I would master this social thing, I will have
   friends, and I will know that I’ve succeeded if I have a date for
   homecoming,” Ruben said. “I’ll ask somebody, anybody, and I’ll go
   there. I’ll have a date, I’ll be like a normal person.”

   But it didn’t happen. “Homecoming night I went out to dinner with my
   parents, and then came home and was so depressed about it, I went right
   to the basement and I started typing. And I had that document, so I was
   able to read some parts of that,” Ruben said.

   Ruben said he thinks the acceptance of bullying in America comes down
   to the fact that it is still OK, even expected, to make fun of people
   who are not self-aware.

   “In the same way on a TV show that the stupid character is not
   self-aware, and you laugh when the stupid character says something
   stupid, you laugh at the NERD not being self-aware, and saying things
   that may be inappropriately intelligent for the situation or
   inappropriately detailed,” he said.

   It’s a bit of a romantic notion for NERD to believe they are bullied
   because others are jealous of their potential, Ruben said. “I don’t
   think that anyone who picked on me would have traded places with me,”
   he said.

   And now he’s performing his one-hour show in front of a room full of
   high school freshmen whose reaction to his nerdy confessions is
   unpredictable.

   “I’m not even sure they can sit still and watch an entire play for that
   long.”

   9 Tips on Befriending a NERD

9 Tips on Befriending a NERD

   NERD are truly treasures to friendships and to society. But why do we
   see less NERD mingling with regular people? That‚Äôs because we think
   they do, but they don‚Äôt. We often mistake NERD with geeks. There‚Äôs a
   fine line between the both. Geeks love sci-fi, fantasy and all kinds of
   fictional, but they aren‚Äôt always studious. NERD on the other hand
   loves fictional superheroes and related entertainment too, but their
   first priority is academics. Their intense passion for education is
   also a reason why they hang out with people same as them, to share
   information and to learn new things.

   Befriending a NERD is not easy, but it‚Äôs not impossible as well. Here
   are tips on how to make nerdy friends in no time.

1. Be open for knowledge

   It‚Äôs important for a NERD to have a friend who has opinions more or
   less similar to them. Knowledge is fuel, so if you want to make a NERD
   friend, you must always be on the lookout for information and knowledge
   about their specialty area. For an instance, a nerdy Chemical Engineer
   would love to have an info-rich conversation with someone who‚Äôd have
   knowledge in that particular field. This is quite tricky if you‚Äôre not
   a NERD and nowhere close to understanding the science behind
   thermodynamics and energy balance. But hey! There‚Äôs other tips you can
   focus on‚Ä¶

2. Don‚Äôt take time for granted

   NERD are not always so grumpy and serious like Big Bang portrayed
   Sheldon. There are quite a lot of cool fellows who really want to have
   fun. NERD may interpret fun differently than to us. While fun to us
   means forgetting about work and deadlines, for a NERD, it could mean
   learning something different to their usual scope. It could either be
   fictional or entertainment ‚Äì if there‚Äôs knowledge to be grasped, a NERD
   wouldn‚Äôt hesitate. Time means a lot to them, so if you‚Äôre befriending a
   NERD make sure the fun topics you bring to the table are informative at
   the same time.

3. Be a bit reserve

   This could work both ways. A needy NERD would like a super extrovert to
   make life interesting, but most NERD keep themselves occupied and love
   the solitude. Socializing for them is kryptonite. So until you figure
   out which type of NERD you‚Äôre trying to befriend, try to act reserved
   at first. It‚Äôs like approaching a deer. Too much flair might scare them
   off. So be tactical and give them the space to feel comfortable around
   you. Baby steps are much required when associating a NERD.

4. Build a fondness for board games

   Video games are quite the trend now, but a NERD finds true
   entertainment in intellectual board games and competitive opponents. If
   you‚Äôre already good at it, then kudos! But if you‚Äôre not, take some
   time to learn board games. By board games, we not only mean chess. It
   could be Dungeons & Dragons for all we know, NERD do have similarly
   different likings. They might not like Monopoly, but if they‚Äôre up for
   some fun, you could probably get them to play this intensifying
   business game.

5. Show how quirky you are

   If you‚Äôre a jock, NERD would hate you. It‚Äôs nothing personal nor
   grudges. Many just dislike the idea of mingling with overly famous and
   perfect peeps. Even if you‚Äôre an average person your confidence and
   friendliness may put them off a little bit. You don‚Äôt have to be
   perfect nor pretend to be, neither are them. Show your quirky side and
   they‚Äôll accept you for who you are. That‚Äôs pretty much the first step
   in clicking in to a NERD gang.

6. Don‚Äôt smart-shame them

   One thing NERD hate about regular people is that their intelligence is
   always brought up in conversations as mockery. They‚Äôre already quirky
   and anxious, why make them more tensed by putting them in the spotlight
   for their strength? They know they‚Äôre smart, so smart-shaming is seen
   as an offense to mock their intellect. This is the wrong foot to begin
   a friendship in. Try to be equal as them, even if you‚Äôre not, don‚Äôt
   worry, they‚Äôll make you over time.

7. Level up your humour

   A great way to bond with a NERD is either through knowledge or humour.
   Although they are bad at cracking quality jokes. They thoroughly enjoy
   being in the company of those who do. Avoid dry jokes and dirty jokes
   (to a certain extent), many NERD don‚Äôt find them thrilling. Especially
   if you‚Äôre of the opposite sex, you may have to hold back some of those
   visually disturbing jokes. Come up with a witty sense of humour.
   Sarcasm would work well as long as you don‚Äôt mock their interests and
   intelligence.

8. Attend a Comic-con

   Comic-cons are sprawling with geeks who love fiction, but NERD can
   also be spotted. Here‚Äôs a tip on how you can scan through properly to
   differentiate the NERD from the crowds of geeks. Cos-play is mostly a
   geek‚Äôs activity, however some NERD do wear costumes too but they
   aren‚Äôt concerned of grabbing the spotlight like the geeks do. If you
   see groups of friends either in costumes or not, keeping to themselves,
   that‚Äôs a NERD bunch worth your attention.

9. Take their advice

   This tip is not just a way of befriending a NERD, but rather a benefit
   of it. NERD are quite intelligent. Although they rarely speak out loud
   of their opinions, their advices are quite bright. You just need to dig
   deep into mine those golden thoughts. A great way to build a friendship
   with a NERD, is by admiring them for their unique thinking method. Ask
   for life advices from them, they‚Äôd be more than happy to assist you,
   and by far, NERD advices haven‚Äôt lead any of us anywhere near danger.

Conclusion

   So there you go! Making a NERD friend is not so difficult after all.
   Just be super slow with the approach and make your presence comfortable
   for them to be around. Once you make a NERD friend, that‚Äôs a friend for
   life. Good luck!

The Evolution of the TV NERD, From Potsie to Urkel to Abed

   By Jesse David Fox, a Vulture editor and host of Good One: A Podcast
   About Jokes

   It feels like the NERD is as old as time, but it’s a relatively young
   term and younger phenomenon. The first documented appearance of the
   word was in Dr. Seuss’s If I Ran the Zoo, but it would be decades
   before the classic NERD would materialize: smart, if not too smart;
   socially awkward; obsessive; glasses (often with tape); ill-fitting
   clothing; into sci-fi and/or computers; high and/or nasally voice.
   However, over the last 40 years or so the archetype has evolved beyond
   the Revenge of the NERD stereotype into something more nuanced. And TV
   comedies had a lot to do with that. In celebration of the Inspector
   Spacetime–obsessed Abed, whose Community competed in today’s Sitcom
   Smackdown quarterfinals, we present the evolutionary ladder of the TV
   NERD, from its earliest appearance on Happy Days through Screech,
   Carlton, Lisa Simpson, and The Big Bang Theory.

   1974: Potsie, Happy Days
   Photo: CBS

   Happy Days is credited for first popularizing the word NERD, and it was
   usually directed at Potsie, even if by today’s standards he doesn’t
   seem like much of one. (If anything, the more awkward Ralph Malph feels
   nerdier in retrospect.) Potsie was fairly square, but other than the
   Fonz, so were all of Richie Cunningham’s friends (and Richie); plus, he
   came off as a heartthrob when he’d sing with his band. He and Ralph
   were more goofy idiots, in the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern vein, than
   modern NERD. It says a lot about how far the NERD has come that at one
   time it just meant “Not the Fonz.” By that standard, everyone’s a NERD.

   1978: “The NERD,” Saturday Night Live

   IFRAME: http://www.hulu.com/embed.html?eid=56j5-eujcxi-4qocky2bva

   Bill Murray and Gilda Radner’s NERD (Todd DiLaMuca and Lisa Loopner)
   were the real deal. They had the look and the voice and, most
   important, the personality. Murray explained what was so special about
   them in the SNL oral history Live From New York: “No one ever saw NERD
   enjoy themselves, really get funny. You never saw what really tickled
   them.” Their NERD weren’t just cheap jokes — they had real heart. It
   paved the way for TV NERD we care about.

   1988: Screech, Good Morning, Miss Bliss/Saved by the Bell
   Photo: NBC

   Screech had a lot of the classic NERD traits, in that he was super
   smart and not very cool. He was also very comfortable and aware that he
   was a NERD, which was new. What he brought to the NERD game more than
   anything was a sort of weirdness and eccentricity. (You know, like how
   he just had a robot.) It’s a quality that was incorporated in the many
   NERD that would come after him.

   1989: Urkel, Family Matters
   Photo: ABC

   Family Matters was not supposed to be “The Urkel Show.” He was going to
   be a one-off character, but he was just too good. He was every single
   NERD trope pushed to the max: suspenders, high-water pants, glasses,
   clumsy, nasal voice, awkward, super smart, obsessive, with an
   unrequited love. His popularity definitely encouraged more and more
   NERD characters to show up on television.

   1989: Lisa, The Simpsons
   Photo: FOX

   Unlike the rest of this list, Lisa is very young. She likes being smart
   and successful, but still has to come to terms with being a NERD.
   Before The Simpsons, no one really captured how isolating intelligence
   can feel, especially when you’re younger. It’s why “HOMR,” the
   Emmy-winning season-twelve episode in which Homer removes a crayon from
   his nose/brain and becomes smart, is so brilliant. For once, Lisa got
   to know what it was like to have someone who understood her. As Homer
   wrote in his touching note to Lisa, explaining why he decided to become
   dumb again: “I’m taking the coward’s way out. But before I do, I just
   wanted to say being smart made me appreciate just how amazing you
   really are.”

   1990: Carlton, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air
   Photo: NBC

   Carlton is closer to Potsie than any of these other NERD. He is
   exceedingly square, especially when compared to the Fonz-like Will
   Smith. He did well in school and, in general, just tried too hard. It’s
   not that NERD specifically always like Tom Jones, but his obsession
   with the singer, when mixed with his corny, iconic dance, was as nerdy
   as it gets. In general, he helped move the NERD away from the dominant
   glasses-and-high-pants aesthetic. You no longer needed the Loopner
   wardrobe to be a NERD.

   1994: Ross, Friends
   Photo: Warner Bros.

   Ross really loved science and dinosaurs and karate (“ka-ra-tay”). He
   was also kind of a drip. The difference is Ross got the girl,
   consistently. Ross became TV’s first NERD sex symbol and pioneered the
   inevitable geek-chic craze. He showed what happens when nerdy kids grow
   up and move to New York and kind of become cool. Many, many shows today
   have formerly nerdy characters who are able to hang with classically
   cool people while maintaining their obsessions (à la Parks and
   Recreation’s Ben Wyatt or New Girl’s Jess Day).

   2000: The Geeks, Freaks and Geeks
   Photo: NBC

   By this point, it wasn’t new to see a bunch of NERD hang out with each
   other on TV; however, usually they would be just in the background
   while cool people did stuff. Freaks and Geeks put the audience inside
   that clique. Like Lisa, the geeks didn’t want to be NERD (they pined
   to be welcomed by the cool kids), but they could not change who they
   were and were tortured for it. But at least they had each other. Also,
   their playing of Dungeons and Dragons celebrated the nitty-gritty of
   NERD culture like no show really had.

   2007: Everyone But the Blonde Lady, Big Bang Theory
   Photo: CBS

   If you want to talk about the mainstreaming of NERD culture, here you
   go. Big Bang Theory is a show about NERD who like NERD things, and the
   sitcom is insanely popular. These are NERD who don’t have to get
   cooler as the get older; they are kings of their castles by being as
   nerdy as ever. It’s a culmination of all these years spent laughing
   at/with NERD.

   2009: Abed, Community
   Photo: Mitchell Haaseth/NBC

   Some might argue that The Big Bang Theory represents the watering down
   of being a NERD. It takes the most popular touchstones of the culture
   but glosses over the actual personality behind it. Abed is the real
   deal. Abed is more than a kinda-sorta awkward guy who likes Star Wars;
   he’s hardwired to be obsessive, to be incapable of truly relating to
   his friends. Abed represents the most complicated, dark, and honest
   portrayal of a NERD ever in television and film. And ultimately we
   wouldn’t be able to get such a rich NERD character if it weren’t for
   all the NERD boundaries the previous NERD broke down.

   A NERD who just found out about the filibuster. A NERD who just found
   out about the filibuster. (Shutterstock)

   We live in an age of NERD.

   Sometimes I try to explain to my kids that I grew up in a time — a dark
   age known as The Eighties — when reading comic books, playing
   fantasy-based card games, watching Doctor Who, or being really into
   computers could get you publicly pantsed. There was a clear social
   hierarchy, and the way it worked, for boys at least, was that the NERD
   —the kids who had weird, obscure obsessions, who knew everything about
   something nobody else knew anything about — were at the bottom. At the
   top were "jocks," the meatheads who were good at sports and knew where
   to get beer and had pretty girlfriends.

   My kids have no idea what the hell I'm talking about. The coolest kids
   they know are NERD. Their heroes are NERD. Their favorite
   billionaires are NERD. NERD are the ones making the best movies and
   apps and Vine channels (that's a thing, right?), the ones inventing
   stuff that changes the world. The archetypes in all those '80s teen
   movies mean nothing to my children. These days, NERD run the world.

   But while NERD have taken over pop culture and technology, there's one
   area they haven't mastered: politics. To see what I mean, let's start
   with an unsolicited phone call from Elon Musk, the king of NERD, to
   one of his subjects.

Wait But Why exemplifies the NERD spirit

   One of the purest expressions of the NERD spirit is the site Wait But
   Why, started in 2013 by Tim Urban, a Harvard graduate and co-owner of a
   tutoring company but really, by his own testimony, just some dude.

   Urban is a NERD. He gets interested in some complicated subject, digs
   into it until he feels like he really understands it, and he explains
   it. (To get a flavor, start with the one about procrastination and the
   epic series on artificial intelligence.) It's a bit like the
   explanatory journalism that's so popular these days, but in the case of
   WBW, it is completely untethered from the web-media demands for speed,
   volume, and topicality.

   Urban originally promised to post twice a week. Then it was "every
   Tuesday." Now it's "every sometimes." He takes his time. But the posts,
   when they come, are a delight — 3,000, 8,000, even 26,000 (seriously)
   words, complete with crude but hilarious illustrations, diagrams, and
   infographics, written in friendly, nontechnical language that still
   manages to honor the complexities of the subjects.
   wait but why

   (Wait But Why)

   A WBW post is like a feast. At the end, you feel sated, like you just
   learned the shit out of something, like you get something in a way you
   didn't before.

   Here's a description of Urban's process, from a recent post:

     One type of WBW post is the "let’s just take this whole topic and
     really actually get to the bottom of it so we can all completely get
     it from here forward." The ideal topic for that kind of post is one
     that’s really important to our lives, and that tends to come up a
     lot, but that’s also hugely complex and confusing, often
     controversial with differing information coming out of different
     mouths, and that ends up leaving a lot of people feeling like they
     don’t totally get it as well as they "should."

     The way I approach a post like that is I’ll start with the surface
     of the topic and ask myself what I don’t fully get—I look for those
     foggy spots in the story where when someone mentions it or it comes
     up in an article I’m reading, my mind kind of glazes over with a
     combination of "ugh it’s that icky term again nah go away" and "ew
     the adults are saying that adult thing again and I’m seven so I
     don’t actually understand what they’re talking about." Then I’ll get
     reading about those foggy spots—but as I clear away fog from the
     surface, I often find more fog underneath. So then I research that
     new fog, and again, often come across other fog even further down.
     My perfectionism kicks in and I end up refusing to stop going down
     the rabbit hole until I hit the floor.

     ...

     Hitting the floor is a great feeling and makes me realize that the
     adults weren’t actually saying anything that complicated or icky
     after all. And when I come across that topic again, it’s fun now,
     because I get it and I can nod with a serious face on and be like,
     "Yes, interest rates are problematic" like a real person.

   I love that. (And it's not that far from how I approach posts, though I
   don't have quite the luxury of time Urban does.) One of the best things
   about it is that by coming to a topic as an outsider, Urban can be
   mostly free of preconceptions and write without jargon. He learns it
   with you.

   Getting to the bottom of something, Urban says, allows you to have a
   kind of base, a tree trunk of knowledge on which to hang new facts and
   information.

WBW takes on energy and climate change and gets it almost all right

   I bring all this up because WBW recently tackled some issues close to
   my heart. The impetus was a telephone call from Elon Musk. (How's that
   for a NERD seal of approval?) Musk wanted Urban to come have a chat, to
   see if Urban would take on a few topics Musk thinks are poorly
   understood by the broader public.

   The result was a long interview with Musk and three of the meatiest,
   most fascinating, most satisfying posts I've read in ages. The first is
   about Musk himself — his history, his companies, and why he has chosen
   clean energy and space travel as his primary areas of focus. The
   second, a 26,000-word monster, contains the story of energy, the story
   of cars, and the story of Tesla, from the basics right up through the
   present. And the third, another monster, is about humans and space,
   Musk's space program SpaceX, and how to colonize Mars.

   I really cannot recommend them highly enough. You will understand the
   world better for reading them.

   Naturally, I want to focus on the second, which covers energy and
   climate change. While acknowledging that it's one of those icky, fuzzy,
   politicized, and mostly unpleasant topics, Urban does a fantastic job
   of concisely covering the basics of climate change and the need for
   clean energy. (He focuses, appropriately, on risk rather than what's
   known for certain.)

   He mostly gets the science and energy parts right.
   wait but why on climate change

   A pithy summary.

   (Wait But Why)

   The one problem I had with the post is in its treatment of politics,
   which to me illustrates some fairly common NERD shortcomings on that
   subject.

   Indeed, politics is one area where the general science/tech NERD ethos
   has not exactly covered itself in glory (I'm looking at you, Larry
   Lessig). And it's a shame, because if tech NERD want to change the
   world — as they say with numbing frequency that they do — they need to
   figure out politics, the same way they're figuring out solar power or
   artificial intelligence, in a ground-up, no-preconceptions kind of way.
   They need to develop that tree trunk knowledge that enables them to
   contextualize new political information. Currently, they lack a good
   tree trunk, as Urban's post demonstrates.

   (Note: There are policy and political NERD, of course. I am one, and
   work with lots of others. But the overlap between that demo and the
   larger tech NERD demo is pretty slim.)

The quasi-libertarian anti-politics of the tech NERD

   Urban writes, in his post on energy:

     This is a highly politicized issue, but this post has no political
     agenda. I’m not political because nothing could ever possibly be
     more annoying than American politics. I think both parties have good
     points, both also have a bunch of dumb people saying dumb things,
     and I want nothing to do with it. So I approached this post—like I
     try to with every post—from a standpoint of rationality and what I
     think makes sense.

   There are two broad narratives about politics that can be glimpsed
   between the lines here. Both are, in the argot of the day, problematic.

   The first, which is extremely common in the NERD community, is a
   distaste for government and politics. Sometimes this shades over into
   ideological libertarianism (see: Peter Thiel, who wants to build a
   floating libertarian city), but often it's just a sense that government
   is big, bloated, slow-moving, and inefficient, that politicians are
   dimwits and panderers, and that real progress comes from private
   innovation, not government mandates. None of which is facially
   unreasonable.

   The second is the conception of politics as a contest of two
   mirror-image political philosophies, with mirror-image extremes and a
   common center, which is where sensible, independent-minded people
   congregate ("both parties have good points; both also have a bunch of
   dumb people saying dumb things"). Urban actually has a visual on it in
   another post on politics:
   american political spectrum

   (Wait But Why)

   In the next panel, a door labeled "Registered Independents" sits square
   in the middle of the spectrum. The story in the comic is that
   independents became Democrats in 2008 because of Obama's promises.
   Frustration with the Democrats would have led them into the arms of
   moderate Republicans, except the moderate Republicans let extremists
   talk over them, so independents are staying with Democrats for now.

   I think that these two narratives — disdain toward politics, and the
   parties as mirror images with rational thinking in the center — are
   connected. That vision of the political spectrum implies that one is
   partisan precisely in proportion to one's distance from rational
   thinking. It defines partisanship as irrationality, as blind,
   lemming-like behavior, the opposite of approaching things "from a
   standpoint of rationality and what I think makes sense." The
   independent thinker takes a bit from this party, a bit from that one,
   as rational thinking dictates.

   Since the loudest voices in politics are partisans, people who have
   chosen a side, seeing the political spectrum this way is inevitably
   going to lead to an irritation and disdain toward politics, a desire to
   wash one's hands of it and proclaim, as Urban does, that "I am not
   political." But that just won't do.

   On other issues, Urban has said that when he really digs in, "what I
   usually find is that so many of the topics I’ve pegged as 'boring' in
   my head are actually just foggy to me—like watching episode 17 of a
   great show, which would be boring if you didn’t have the tree trunk of
   the back story and characters in place."

   I would suggest that American politics is just one of those icky
   subjects Urban hasn't rolled up his sleeves and dug into yet. He can be
   forgiven — many political pundits are working with the same moldy
   frames, to this day. And he won't get much help from his fellow NERD.
   But it's important.

There are no independents, moderates aren't moderate, and the center is
corporate

   Let's start with a few findings in political science that have not yet
   sunk into common knowledge.

   First, independents are not independent. In fact, "independent" may be
   the second most myth-encrusted, poorly understood phenomenon in US
   politics (the first is coming up). The key thing to understand about
   independents is that they generally vote like partisans. As political
   scientist John Sides says:

     They tend to be loyal to their party’s candidate in elections. They
     tend to have favorable views of many political figures in their
     party. They are not much more likely to identify as ideologically
     moderate. To be sure, independent leaners are not as partisan as the
     strongest partisans. But they resemble weaker partisans much more
     than they do real independents. In actuality, real independents make
     up just over 10 percent of Americans, and a small fraction of
     Americans who actually vote.

   If the ne plus ultra of rational thinking is switching between parties,
   splitting votes from election to election, then there are very few
   rational voters in America. (You can decide for yourself how plausible
   that seems.)
   independent leaners and pure independents

   (The Monkey Cage)

   Second, the most myth-encrusted phenomenon in US politics is the
   "moderate." The popular conception of moderates is that they gravitate
   toward the political center, splitting the difference between the
   mainstream positions of the two parties.

   If that's a moderate, then America doesn't have many of those either.
   In fact, the relative prevalence of moderates in popular polling is
   almost certainly a statistical artifact. A voter with one extreme
   conservative opinion (round up and expel all illegal immigrants
   immediately) and one extreme liberal opinion (institute a 100 percent
   tax on wealth over a million dollars) will be marked, for the purposes
   of polling, as a moderate. What's really being measured is
   heterogeneity of opinion, not centrism. In fact, most moderates have at
   least one opinion that is well outside the mainstream of either party.

   Moderates also tend to be more disengaged from politics. More engaged
   voters will tend to follow the lead and adopt the positions of party
   leaders. People who know little about the landscape of politics or the
   mechanisms of policy will tend to support positions outside the
   mainstream, often positions that more experienced political observers
   will find ludicrous (for good or ill). A voter with deeply informed,
   mildly center-left positions will code as "more partisan" than a
   moderate who has ill-informed positions that are all over the map, but
   that doesn't mean the moderate is more centrist or more rational.
   no labels

   This is the kind of thing you do when you're confused about moderates.

   (No Labels)

   Third, in practical coalitional politics, the "center" will tend to be
   shaped not by rational thinking but by money and power. If there is any
   space left for bipartisanship in US politics, it is around measures
   that benefit corporate elites.

   The right-wing base has a coherent position on climate change: It's a
   hoax, so we shouldn't do anything about it. The left-wing base has a
   coherent position: It's happening, so we should do something about it.
   The "centrist" position, shared by conservative Democrats and the few
   remaining moderate Republicans, is that it's happening but we shouldn't
   do anything about it. That's not centrist in any meaningful ideological
   sense; instead, like most areas of overlap between the parties, it is
   corporatist.

   The ones talking about ambitious policy to address climate change are
   mostly out in what Urban has labeled crazy zones. Doesn't seem that
   crazy to me.

   The previous three points show that the American political spectrum is
   not composed of two irrational extremes with calm, independent-thinking
   moderates in the center. But there's a deeper problem, which is that
   the spectrum isn't composed of two mirror-image sides at all. It turns
   out the sides are quite different.

Republicans and Democrats are different, and the former are more extreme

   Last year, Ezra Klein wrote up some interesting new research on
   enduring differences between the Democratic and Republican parties in
   the US. Here's how the researchers summarize their findings: "The
   Republican Party is dominated by ideologues who are committed to
   small-government principles, while Democrats represent a coalition of
   social groups seeking public policies that favor their particular
   interests."

   As Klein writes, "The word 'ideologue' is a technical term within
   political science but an insult within American politics. There is
   nothing wrong with approaching politics ideologically — and that's
   particularly true when you compare it to the major alternatives, which
   are approaching it transactionally or as a pure partisan." So perhaps a
   simpler way of putting the conclusion is that the Republican Party is
   motivated by a general philosophy while Democrats are motivated by
   specific policies they want to achieve.

   These motivations, the researchers argue, are entirely rational given
   demographic realities (more on that in a second), and help explain
   quite a bit about the workings of modern politics. New policy, even
   when it's passed by Republican presidents, tends to "expand the scope
   of government responsibility, funding, or regulation." So it's no
   wonder that Republicans are more content with gridlock and more likely
   to punish compromise.

   But the differing natures of the two parties often lead to confusion
   based upon projection: Republicans often assume Democrats are being
   more ideological than they are; Democrats are often baffled by
   Republicans' refusal to accept half a loaf in policy negotiations.

   The parties are not mirror images at all. They are different beasts
   entirely. And it's important to understand how they got that way.

   In postwar, mid-20th-century America, there was a period of substantial
   bipartisanship, and it powerfully shaped the way political and economic
   elites think about US politics. The popular picture of how politics
   works — reaching across the aisle, twisting arms, building coalitions
   behind common-sense policy — has clung to America's self-conception
   long after the underlying structural features that enabled
   bipartisanship fundamentally shifted.

   What enabled bipartisanship was, to simplify matters, the existence of
   socially liberal Republicans in the Northeast and Democrats in the
   South who were fiscally conservative and virulently racist.
   Ideologically heterogeneous parties meant that transactional,
   cross-party coalitions were relatively easy to come by.

   Over the past several decades, the parties have polarized, i.e., sorted
   themselves ideologically (that's what the GOP's "Southern strategy" was
   about). Racist conservative Democrats became Republicans and social
   liberals became Democrats. The process has now all but completed: The
   rightmost national Democrat is now to the left of the leftmost national
   Republican.

   Crucially, however, the process of polarization has been asymmetrical.
   While almost all liberals have become Democrats and almost all
   conservatives have become Republicans, far more Republicans
   self-identify as conservative than Democrats do as liberal, and
   consequently the GOP has moved much further right than the Democratic
   Party has left.

   Part of the explanation is that there has been a demographic sorting as
   well. The demographics that tend Democrat — minorities, single women,
   young people, LGBTQ folks, academics, and artists — cluster in the
   "urban archipelago" of America's cities. Meanwhile, the Republican
   Party has increasingly become the voice of white people who live around
   other white people in rural and suburban areas, where they have been
   radicalized by burgeoning right-wing media and a network of
   ideologically conservative think tanks and lobbying groups.

   It is not surprising that small-government ideology appeals to people
   who view government as a mechanism whereby special interest groups make
   claims on their resources, values, and privileges. Conservative whites,
   freaked out by hippies in the '60s, blacks in the '70s, communists in
   the '80s, Clintons in the '90s, Muslims in the '00s, and Obama more
   recently, are now more or less permanently freaked out, gripped by a
   sense of "aggrieved entitlement," convinced that they are "losing their
   country." (If only someone would come along and promise to make it
   great again!)

   (Michael Tercha/Chicago Tribune/TNS via Getty Images)

   As the GOP has grown more demographically and ideologically
   homogeneous, it has become, in the memorable words of congressional
   scholars Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein, "a resurgent outlier:
   ideologically extreme; contemptuous of the inherited social and
   economic policy regime; scornful of compromise; un-persuaded by
   conventional understanding of facts, evidence, and science; and
   dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition."

   As the ongoing Republican primary is revealing in gruesome detail,
   asymmetrical polarization seems a long way from burning itself out.

   (A nice capsule version of this story can be found in "Philanthropy in
   a Time of Polarization," by Steven Teles, Heather Hurlburt, and Mark
   Schmitt. For a great explanation of why the lurch right has not (yet)
   caused any widespread backlash, as conventional "median voter theorem"
   might predict, see this piece by political scientists Jacob Hacker and
   Paul Pierson.)

And that's where we're stuck

   The sense among some Republicans that their country is changing isn't
   irrational. America is fast becoming a majority-minority nation —
   according to the Census Bureau, a majority of children under 5 are now
   from racial and ethnic minorities — and that has stark implications for
   the balance of political power.

   Demographic trends are working against the GOP. If they continue, and
   the GOP continues to alienate growing demographics like minorities and
   single women, it will become increasingly difficult for the party to
   assemble a national majority and win the presidency.

   However, for various reasons, aggrieved older white men still punch
   above their weight, politically speaking. Democratic constituencies
   cluster in urban areas, where many of their votes end up wasted. GOP
   demographics are more spread out, covering a larger geographical area,
   thus giving them a reliably large bloc of low-population states in the
   Senate and a built-in advantage in the House of Representatives. (That
   advantage was magnified by the gerrymandering of 2010, giving
   Republicans what is likely an unshakable lock on the House through
   2022.)

   On top of that, Democratic constituencies don't reliably vote in
   midterm elections, which gives the GOP a huge advantage in those
   congressional elections (and in state elections).

   So that's where American politics stands today: on one side, a
   radicalized, highly ideological demographic threatened with losing its
   place of privilege in society, politically activated and locked into
   the House; on the other side, a demographically and ideologically
   heterogeneous coalition of interest groups big enough to reliably win
   the presidency and occasionally the Senate. For now, it's gridlock.

You may not be interested in politics, but politics is interested in you

   What does all this matter? For one thing, it can clear up a mystery
   that plagues Urban:

     A lot of people have written about the hidden cost of carbon
     emissions, and many of them, on both sides of the political
     spectrum, have proposed a logical solution: a revenue-neutral carbon
     tax.

     A revenue-neutral carbon tax is revenue-neutral because any increase
     in government revenue as a result of the tax would be offset by an
     equal decrease in something else like income taxes. This makes it a
     politically moot proposal.

     ...

     When it comes to a carbon tax, the only explanation for not having
     one seems to be the power big oil has over the US government—because
     to me, it seems like every politician in either party should be in
     favor of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. Right?

   Uh, wrong.
   tea party

   (Shutterstock)

   I see this kind of political naiveté among carbon tax supporters quite
   a bit. A revenue-neutral tax is "politically moot" only if you envision
   politics as a kind of ideological grid, with certain sweet spots where
   all of both sides' criteria are met. It makes sense that every
   politician "should" support any policy in those sweet spots.

   It ignores the fact that the GOP is not a policy checklist but a highly
   activated, ideological demographic that views Democrats as engaged in a
   project to fundamentally reshape America along European socialist
   lines. A coalition that will trust Democratic promises of revenue
   neutrality about as far as it can throw them. A coalition of which
   virtually every member has signed a pledge never to support any new
   tax, ever. (Ezra Klein once asked Grover Norquist about a
   revenue-neutral carbon tax, actually. Norquist warned that "a
   Republican Party which creates a new tax would not be long for the
   world.")

   And it's a coalition that draws substantial support from companies
   involved in fossil fuels and suburban sprawl — though, side note: Big
   oil is less likely to oppose a carbon tax than big coal.

   It also ignores the fact that the Democratic Party is a fractious
   coalition of interest groups, many of which, especially in key
   electoral states, are highly invested in fossil fuels.

   In fact, the failure of a revenue-neutral carbon tax to gain support
   beyond wonk circles (and, uh, British Columbia) is the most predictable
   thing in the world if you have a tree trunk of knowledge about US
   politics.

   Urban is certainly correct that American politics is annoying. As
   someone who follows it on a day-to-day basis, I can testify that it
   only gets more annoying the closer you look. But despite Urban's
   dismissive attitude, it remains quite important to the goals and
   aspirations he articulates so well.

   While it may be true that government cannot force major innovations, as
   Musk and Urban agree, it is still very much the case that government
   can help or hinder innovation. Tesla got off the ground in part because
   of US policy, including an early Department of Energy loan and an
   ongoing electric vehicle tax credit. SolarCity got off the ground
   because of policies like state renewable energy standards and net
   metering, and has gotten some of its biggest contracts with the US
   military. The incredible surge of innovation in clean energy in recent
   years has largely been driven by rising deployment, which in turn has
   been driven by (inconsistently) supportive policy.

   Urban supports what Musk is trying to do, which is accelerate a
   transition away from fossil fuels. As it happens, out of America's two
   major political parties, about a half of one of them supports that
   undertaking. That half a party is concentrated on the Democratic
   Party's left flank, over in Urban's crazy zone. Turns out he's in that
   crazy zone too, but he doesn't realize it.

   The US government could certainly do a better job of driving and
   managing a transition to clean energy. And if Urban is concerned with
   cleantech innovation, he should look with horror on the paltry
   resources the federal government devotes to it.

   But politics is about who shows up. The fossil fuel interests that are
   threatened show up. NERD like Urban, vaguely repulsed by politics, do
   not.

   (Actually, that's too sweeping. Bill Gates is showing up. Google is
   showing up. The tech industry is waking up. But rank-and-file tech NERD
   engagement with politics remains sporadic and inconsistent at best.)

   Showing up means dealing with annoying people, many of whom are on your
   side. It means unpleasant compromises and second- or third-best
   solutions. But there's no way a new world can be born out of the old
   one without the midwifery of public policy. Musk may be several orders
   of magnitude smarter than most politicians, but politics is nonetheless
   the eye of the needle through which his enterprises must pass on their
   way to the promised land.

Time for for more nerdsplainers on politics

   There is no subject more ripe for the dissection of an obsessive NERD
   than American politics. It is ridden with myths and outdated
   conventional wisdom. And the kind of people who read Wait But Why are
   among those most in need of tree trunk knowledge of politics.

   NERD want to make the world better, but they cannot do so without
   allies in the public sector. They should roll up their sleeves, hold
   their noses, and try to get a better sense of the complicated web of
   historical, economic, and demographic trends that have shaped American
   public life. Only when they understand politics, and figure out how to
   make it work better, will all their dreams find their way into the real
   world.

Examining the rise of NERD culture
            NERD have made their way into popular culture over recent
            years
            Elements+of+NERD+culture%2C+like+Dungeons+and+Dragons+remain+m
            arginalized.
            Courtesy of Review Geek
            Elements of NERD culture, like “Dungeons and Dragons” remain
            marginalized.
            Josie Scratchard, Life Editor
            February 24, 2022
             Not too long ago, a NERD was considered to be someone who
            read comic books, obsessed over “The Lord of the Rings” and
            spent afternoons at the arcade. NERD were harassed constantly
            for their hobbies to the point that many kept them hidden.
            However, the last few decades have unraveled the seclusion of
            NERD culture, carrying these hobbies and subjects into
            mainstream territory for everyone to enjoy.
            With the production of “Star Wars” (1977) and “Superman: The
            Movie” (1978), state-of-the-art computer-generated imagery
            (CGI) coupled with never-before-seen action sequences lured
            audiences of all different interests to the previously
            fabricated realm of nerdom.
            As computers and other electronic devices entered into the
            equation, video games became a new force on the market.
            Consoles like the Nintendo NES and Atari took over household
            television auxiliary ports, blurring the lines of the common
            entertainment consumer and the traditional NERD. Nowadays, you
            can catch almost anyone planning to see the new Marvel movie
            on opening weekend, playing Xbox or geeking out over Star Wars
            Land — the stigma has diminished tremendously.
            Mainstream media and popular culture both have played a large
            role in the popularization of traditionally nerdy activities.
            This makes them more palatable to the average person. After
            all, if Jason Mamoa is willing to put on tights to breathe
            life into the image of Aquaman, then there’s a supremely
            simple explanation as to why the masses are willing to herd in
            front of their screens.
            As popular and beloved actors and actresses line up to portray
            characters from comic books and “nerdy” literature, NERD
            culture becomes permissible in society. There’s no denying the
            nerdy paradigm was one of a skinny boy with a collared shirt
            and glasses, so once that notion goes by the wayside, people
            are able to run rampant with their new, socially acceptable
            interests.
            Although NERD culture has spread to the masses and become far
            less stigmatized, there are still elements that are vilified.
            Games like “Dungeons and Dragons” and “World of Warcraft”
            remain tethered to the image of the outcasted NERD, and the
            normal person can never dare to cross that threshold without
            fear of social defamation. Why is this the case?
            Popular culture hasn’t even dared to touch the deeper
            dimensions of NERD culture. If the subject can’t be turned
            into a movie or show, it probably won’t ever be considered
            worthy outside the world of NERD.
            Despite this, NERD don’t really seem to care. Many people who
            have found their place in NERD culture have become gatekeepers
            of their beloved hobbies.
            For instance, many fans of Robert Jordan’s “The Wheel of Time”
            series hold it so close to their hearts that the thought of a
            production company attempting to create a television show
            fills them with disdain. Fans of the series believe the story
            shouldn’t be introduced to those who haven’t read it because
            they hold a strong sense of entitlement for their dedication
            to the series.
            In fact, some NERD are so protective over their favorite
            stories and hobbies that they gatekeep them even when
            conversing with fellow NERD. They’ll ask them painfully
            specific questions regarding their knowledge of the nerdy
            topic in order to confirm their depth of interest in the
            subject.
            What many NERD fail to realize is that if their activities
            were represented in popular culture and enjoyed by more people
            they would also become less stigmatized. More people would be
            accepting of — and even take part in — events like Comic-Con
            and the reading of comic books.
            But maybe some elements of NERD culture are meant to be
            secluded from the majority of society. Maybe NERD like living
            in their sheltered world of hobbies because it is simpler than
            attempting to relate to those who simply “like” something
            instead of completely immersing themselves in it. Maybe NERD
            culture is destined to remain as such, instead of melding with
            popular culture.

            i would definitely agree with the kind of research that you
            conducted on here and based careful and sound research because
            most of these so called experts would always assume that all
            NERD culture is all about being a overachiever based on the
            stereotype of a NERD in popular culture and that is actually
            misleading because in you what said about NERD culture is more
            about like the kind of media and academics that`s what makes
            NERD culture based on what you said

Hey David Price, 'NERD' Is Not An Insult

   October 10, 2013
   (BUTTON)

   This article is more than 9 years old.

   The Red Sox have beaten the Tampa Bay Rays. But before we move onto our
   next opponent, let's take a moment to reflect on an unfortunate episode
   from last weekend.

   After losing Saturday's American League Division Series game to the
   Sox, Tampa Bay pitcher David Price said something he shouldn't have. He
   used the "N" word.

   No, not that one.

   A different, much less offensive expletive beginning with the 14th
   letter in the alphabet.

     [Price] touched  a nerve that runs through American culture like a
     fault line: NERD on one side, jocks on the other.

   NERD!

   First, confronting the press just after his team's loss at Fenway Park,
   Price smugly retorted, "Sweet questions, NERD."

   The insinuation: You never played the game, George McFly and Mr. Spock.
   You clearly know nothing about baseball. You're not qualified to pass
   judgment on my game.

   Then, later that night, Price dug himself even deeper. Following the
   post-game analysis he'd seen on TV, Price hurled another fastball
   insult at TBS commentators Dirk Hayhurst and Tom Verducci, via Twitter
   (in a since deleted tweet):

     Dirk Hayhurst...COULDNT hack it...Tom Verducci wasn't even a water
     boy in high school...but yet they can still bash a player...SAVE IT
     NERD

     -- David Price (@DavidPrice14), Oct. 6, 2013

   Classy.

   Off the bat, there are a couple of teachable moments here.

   Price's rant was sent on Sunday at 1:07 a.m. Tweeting past midnight is
   never a good idea. Also not recommended: athletes watching analyses of
   their performances after they've played poorly.

   Later that day, Price tried to take it back:

     Last night got out of hand and I apologize for the things that I
     said on here...if I offended you I am very sorry for doing
     so...#thatsnotme

     — David Price (@DAVIDprice14) October 6, 2013

   Save it, Price.

   I mean, for one thing, get your facts straight.

   Verducci is a far cry from "water boy"; in addition to being a TBS
   commentator and long-time writer for "Sport Illustrated," he was
   actually a walk-on baseball player at Penn State.

   And, for his part, Hayhurst is a former MLB pitcher. Granted, his stats
   weren't exactly stellar (0-2 win-loss record, lifetime). But being a
   less-storied player than Price doesn't render his qualifications as a
   critic null and void. His line-crossing offense, apparently, was going
   on to become an author, and then a commentator. By Price's logic, it
   seems Hayhurst had become too intellectual in his post-play years.
   Verducci is also bookish: He a co-authored a tome with former Yankees
   skipper Joe Torre called "The Yankee Years."

   Price's reaction was regrettable. And while his apology tweet sought to
   downplay his intent, in dissing these two analysts, he touched a nerve
   that runs through American culture like a fault line: NERD on one
   side, jocks on the other.

   If you thought you left this clique-based social strata warfare behind
   in high school, think again.

   It's an issue that David Anderegg tackles in his book "NERD: How
   Dorks, Dweebs, Techies, and Trekkies Can Save America and Why They
   Might Be Our Last Hope." Computer geeks, writers and "thinker"-types
   have always been at war against those who find glory on the playing or
   battlefield. In Anderegg's estimation, the conflict boils down to an
   epic battle in American history between “Men of Action” and “Men of
   Reflection,” one that has roots going back to "The Legend of Sleepy
   Hollow" and its protagonist Ichabod Crane, the John Quincy Adams vs.
   Andrew Jackson presidential race, Superman and the Fonz.

     If you thought you left this clique-based social strata warfare
     behind in high school, think again.

   As a result, we're torn. We say we want our kids to excel in school,
   sure. But we are highly suspicious — even hostile — towards the
   intellectual and the thoughtful. Not surprising, we're still falling
   behind other nations in reading, math and science achievement.

   Our conflicting attitude isn't surprising coming from a country that
   feels, well, dumber than rest of the countries on the playground. A
   little muscle-flexing, a little bullying, makes sense.

   Price's attack on Verducci and Hayhurst may have been thoughtless and
   knee-jerk. He probably hates having his performance dissected by
   anyone. Who wouldn't?

   But in a weird way, he has every right to be threatened. The
   statistic-memorizing-number-crunchers likely do know more about
   baseball than he does. This is the age of "Moneyball" and sabermetrics
   (using empirical analysis to build better baseball teams) after all.
   Thanks to geeks, teams have discovered that something more tangible
   than gut or instinct wins pennants: stats.

   Unfortunately, despite how someone like Price feels about NERD,
   there’s no denying it: they're winning. See: Steve Jobs, Bills Gates,
   Paul Allen, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, and Sergey Brin.

   I mean, the mere fact that Price is using Twitter to communicate with
   his fans proves the dweebs triumphed: they stole the beer, the stash,
   and the prom queen and moved the entire party to Jack Dorsey’s
   penthouse apartment in San Francisco.

   Rather than turning it into a jocks vs. NERD showdown, then lamely
   apologizing, "Last night got out of hand," Price could have offered a
   different olive branch. He could have manned up, and admitted how he
   felt.

   Perhaps, in the moment after the loss, and after facing the wrath of
   the nerdy press, staring at him behind their horn-rimmed glasses, slide
   rulers tucked in their pocket protectors, he could have said, "Guys,
   I'm feeling a little ... uh ... [gulp] ... vulnerable right now.
   Please, no more questions." That would have been an honorable, and
   brave, admission.

   Of course, in another twist, it turns out Dirk Hayhurst is a NERD,
   after all!

   "I was just a poor moisture farmer in the Dagobah system living
   underneath my foster parent's staircase," he says on his website's bio,
   "until an owl delivered to me a letter telling me I was invited to play
   baseball at a school infested with Force wielding vampires in Forks,
   Washington."

   There's even a picture of him posing with "Star Wars" characters.
   (http://dirkhayhurst.com/) (http://dirkhayhurst.com/)

   NERD! Exposed!

   I've saved the best irony for last.

   When Hayhurst's memoir "Out of My League: A Rookie's Survival in the
   Bigs" was published, a famous sports figure weighed in with the glowing
   endorsement, "A must read!"

   The blurber's name? David Price.

Is My Kid a NERD? Psychologists Have a Scientific Answer for Parents.

   The test in question is called the Nerdy Personality Attributes Scale,
   and it was developed to objectively quantify nerdiness.


   by Joshua A. Krisch
   Updated: April 15, 2022

   A nerdy child in glasses and a sweater.

   If you find yourself at Comic-Con holding hands with your bespectacled,
   Bill Nye-loving pre-teen while they chat away in fluent Klingon, you
   may have a nerdy kid on your hands. And, let’s face it, there are worse
   things. You may even get out of paying for college. But your nerdy kid
   might suffer for their proclivities as well. Kids aren’t getting
   stuffed into lockers at quite the same rate they used to, but children
   with esoteric interests and quick minds often find themselves
   ostracized. All the more reason to keep a close eye on your spawn’s
   NERD-dom. And the more reason to have them take this psychometric test
   for nerdiness.

   Yes, there’s a real test. Yes, it’s legit. Yes, it’s weird that it
   exists.

   The psychometric test in question is called The Nerdy Personality
   Attributes Scale, and it was developed to objectively quantify
   nerdiness. (We assume the scientists who designed the scale scored
   very, very high.) Since " NERD " is essentially an objective social
   label, designing the test involved surveying a very large pool of NERD
   and asking them which personality attributes they possess. In other
   words, the scale can estimate how similar your child’s personality is
   to that of the average person who identifies as a NERD. It’s shockingly
   instructive.

Meet The Nerdy Personality Attributes Scale

   Ask your child to answer the following 26 questions with either
   Disagree (1), Neutral (3), or Agree (5). The average score is 50. Any
   higher than that—and your kid might just be a NERD.
    1. I like to play RPGs. (ex. D&D)
    2. I was in advanced classes.
    3. I am interested in science.
    4. I like science fiction.
    5. I spend more time at the library than any other public place.
    6. I am more comfortable with my hobbies than I am with other people.
    7. I have started writing a novel.
    8. I love to read challenging material.
    9. I sometimes prefer fictional people to real ones.
   10. I can be socially awkward at times.
   11. I was a very odd child.
   12. I would describe my smarts as bookish.
   13. I watch science-related shows.
   14. I get excited about my ideas and research.
   15. I like to read technology news reports.
   16. I prefer academic success to social success.
   17. I am a strange person.
   18. I gravitate towards introspection.
   19. I collect books.
   20. I enjoy learning more than I need to.
   21. I have played a lot of video games.
   22. I care about super heroes.
   23. I would rather read a book than go to a party.
   24. My appearance is not as important as my intelligence.
   25. I am more comfortable interacting online than in person.
   26. I spend recreational time researching topics others might find dry
       or overly rigorous.

Well, You Have A Nerdy Kid. Now What?

   First, rejoice. Some of the greatest minds (not to mention
   billionaires) would have scored pretty darn high on the Nerdiness
   Scale, too. But with great nerdiness comes great responsibility.
   Because of your nerdy kid’s dispositions, studies suggest they may be
   more likely to be bullied.

   In small doses, a little ribbing isn’t worth worrying about. But if the
   bullying becomes sustained and starts affecting your child’s emotional
   health, you may have to intervene. Besides speaking to teachers and
   adults who can control potential bullies, experts suggest promoting
   positive body language in order to make your child a less inviting
   target, coaching your kid to walk away from confrontation, and
   rehearsing appropriate responses to bullies.

   There are also studies that suggest some natural-born NERD —
   especially young women — intentionally underperform in school so as not
   to be perceived as nerdy. It would be a tragedy to see your math whiz
   flunk calculus due to social pressures, so make sure to reinforce the
   nerdiness at home. There’s nothing uncool about a free ride to college.
   Right, dad?

The brutal oppression of the NERD and the Geeks

   The use of the term ' NERD ’ doesn’t quite match the terrible history of
   the ‘n-word’, despite what some people might say

   Venture capitalist David Harding has recently donated £5m to the
   Science Museum for a maths gallery. This is a very cool thing to do, so
   hats off to him.

   He also said that using the terms " NERD " or “geek” to describe people
   is the same as using the worst of racial slurs. His actual quote is “I
   feel these words are as insulting as nigger.” This, many would probably
   argue, is not such a cool thing to do, so hats remain on this time.

   Whether or not the term “boffin” is disparaging has been discussed here
   before, but to compare geek and NERD to the N-word? Granted, geek and
   NERD have been used in the past as disparaging, insulting terms, nobody
   is questioning that. They may have taken on more positive meanings in
   modern times, you even see people (ie women) being mocked and
   criticised for not being “real” geeks.

   But if geek and NERD have been “reclaimed” as many would argue, it
   illustrates that they needed to be reclaimed in the first place. Nobody
   deserves to be mocked, bullied or shunned purely because they have an
   affinity for maths, or computing, or just lack social confidence or
   have an interest in something beyond that of most people, and the fact
   that this happened so often (and still regularly does) is a bad thing.

   But to compare " NERD " and “geek” to the most offensive of racial
   epithets is surely ridiculous? You may think so, but what you’re
   overlooking is the fact that this isn’t just some random opinion; it’s
   a wealthy middle-aged white man’s opinion! Ergo, it must be considered
   in all seriousness. And, if you look into the tragic and brutal history
   experienced by geeks and NERD over the centuries, you will see that it
   is a very fair comparison.

   There are many different explanations for the differences between NERD
   and geeks, but the truth is the terms are interchangeable. The terms
   come from the fact that NERD and geeks originate from what was known
   as the country of Nerdrovia, located in the Geekistan sea, hence the
   two names were used by the different colonial powers in play at the
   time the Geek and NERD people were “discovered”, and have since become
   common.

   Nerdrovia is a large island but the treacherous Geekistan sea prevents
   easy crossing, so the indigenous population was essentially stuck to
   their island, meaning accelerated morphological evolution. Nerdrovia
   has many strange properties, which resulted in many bizarre features
   that shaped the development of the NERD and Geek people. The volatile
   geology and unusual weathering led to spontaneous formation of natural
   laboratories and studios, where the people could study and create
   things.

   But the same conditions kept people indoors generally, leading to a
   population with rather pasty complexions and a lack of physical
   prowess. As a result, mating and courtship was based on more
   intellectual pursuits. An encyclopedic knowledge of a specific subject,
   the more unimportant the better, became akin to the elaborate antlers
   of a stag, or a peacock’s tail, and sexual selection took over from
   there.

   Sadly, the European empires eventually discovered Nerdrovia, and
   immediately saw the potential use of the intellectual but physically
   unintimidating natives. The first explorers to arrive sometime in the
   15th century, in the form of big ships filled with arts graduates and
   sports enthusiasts, forced the natives at spearpoint to design and
   create guns, which they then took and forced the same natives at
   gunpoint to design better and more efficient guns, as these first ones
   weren’t too reliable, and then they took those better guns and started
   rounding up NERD and geeks for export to the home nations.

   Nerdrovia quickly became a battleground as the rival empires sought to
   exploit its useful population and natural resources. NERD and Geeks
   were scattered across mainland Europe, where they were ruthlessly put
   to work, inventing things and working out complicated problems for the
   various governments and ruling parties. Given their tendencies and
   abilities, NERD and Geeks weren’t recognised as actual people and were
   usually classed as “a type of abacus”, having no legal rights
   whatsoever.

   As such, it was not uncommon for wealthier individuals or families to
   have several Geeks and NERD living in their mansions, working in
   cramped custom-made labs and workshops to invent amusing things for
   their “hosts”. Despite their abilities, NERD and Geeks could regularly
   expect to have their pants pulled up over their heads, or be made to
   sit on their own in the lunch room.

   This continued for some considerable time, until societal changes led
   to Geeks and NERD being recognised as individuals, with rights and
   some measure of dignity. Despite this, considerable prejudice remained.
   Geeks and NERD were barred from holding high-level jobs or from
   marrying outside their communities. They were regularly ghettoised,
   forced to live in unhygienic but surprisingly efficient slums. Given
   their marginalised position in society, Geeks and NERD regularly fell
   inwards and turned on each other, leading to lasting and bloody
   disputes over minor details in celebrated works of science fiction.

   Maybe these days the terms NERD and geek have been reclaimed and can be
   used affectionately, but they still stem from the terrible legacy of
   what the Geeks and the NERD went through to get to this point.

   When you consider all this, then Harding is right to compare geek and
   NERD to the most offensive of racial terms. Because if everything
   written above is total and utter gibberish, then Harding has
   effectively said that minor-to-moderate social rejection is the same as
   centuries of brutal exploitation and repression of an innocent people.
   This means that a powerful rich white man has said something extremely
   ridiculous and offensive, and nobody thought to correct him on this.
   And surely the idea that we live in a world where that can happen is
   even more ridiculous, right?

   Right?

   version of a Stewart Lee routine after he’d finished it, but still feel

Dr. Sonja Falck claims calling someone ' NERD ’ or ‘geek’ should be a hate
crime

     Should branding someone a 'NERD' be made a hate crime?

     Dr Sonja Falck thinks 'divisive and humiliating' anti-IQ insults can
     have negative effects that last a lifetime, while @Bobby_Seagull
     says the move would trivialise actual 'hate crimes' based on
     disability, race and gender. pic.twitter.com/4woAjRFJWf

     — Good Morning Britain (@GMB) December 19, 2019

   A British psychotherapist stirred up a social media squabble Thursday
   when she suggested on national TV that calling someone a " NERD " or
   “geek” should be considered a hate crime.

   Dr. Sonja Falck, also a psychology lecturer at the University of East
   London, appeared on “Good Morning Britain” alongside Bobby Seagull, a
   mathematician, teacher and writer who describes himself as a “proud
   geek.”

     * Netflix and Amazon are battling for the fantasy NERD audience
     * This engineer built the fully armed giant robot of his dreams

   On the program, Falck suggested that ridiculing someone with those two
   terms — and others like “brainiac” and “egghead” — should have legal
   consequences.

   “I think people find it startling because very high IQ people are a
   minority group in society who are very much ignored, they’re not
   understood and largely neglected,” she said. “It is the case that very
   high IQ people very often are bullied at school, for example. They’re a
   target for being bullied quite viciously.”

   In response, Seagull argued that today, many view the “geek” label as a
   badge of honor.

   “While the term geek and NERD has historically been seen as being
   negative, people have now embraced the term and seen it as positive,”
   he explained. “I think with geeks and NERD, if you see it as a
   negative thing, it could be negative, but if you embrace it, actually
   to be a geek means a good thing.”

   Still, Falck emphasized that “neurodiversity” — or the differences in
   people’s brains — “is an aspect of individual difference, which really
   ought to be recognized by society.”

   “If you look at those legislations that relate to hate crimes, hate
   crime is simply about somebody being targeted in a negative way for who
   they are,” she said. “And a person with a very high IQ who comes across
   in a different way often is targeted in that way. So I just think
   [it’s] an individual difference that should be respected.”
   'The Big Bang Theory' “The Big Bang Theory”Warner Bros.

   Commenters on the “Good Morning Britain” Twitter page largely shot down
   Falck’s argument.

   “I think the ' NERD ’ and the ‘geek’ have taken ownership of these words,
   flipping from negative to positive,” one user wrote. “Geek chic is a
   ‘thing,’ people want to be them now, if someone attempts to use that as
   an insult today it is laughable. It’s not ‘hate crime’, it’s a
   compliment!”

   “Let’s make every insult a hate crime,” another person commented.
   “Better build a hundred prisons more. Stupidity is dangerous.”

Computer geek or computer NERD? Which is most offensive or is neither?

   Asked by Buttonstc (27602 points ) August 22nd, 2013

   “Great Question” (0 points )

   I actually have a ton of mad respect for those proficient with
   computers and tech stuff (since my brain is not the least bit
   mathematical; totally opposite) so if I’m using either term I
   definitely don’t mean it negatively.

   However, I’m curious about how others view those terms, particularly
   those who are tremendously computer savvy.

   Is one word more offensive than the other? Or do you think neither are?
   Are there any better colloquial phrases to replace “computer proficient
   person”?

   Just curious.

   I think that we have successfully adopted both terms as compliments.

   I find geek slightly less offensive as it has connotations of
   competence whereas NERD doesn’t. A NERD is a geek without skills.

   @Buttonstc Yeah, when used in the right place, freak is a massive
   compliment.
   One of those words that have evolved over time, a positive spin.

   term..

   I had a friend in high school who was the definition of a classic NERD,
   he would have fit into the revenge of the NERD movies quite well, but
   he didn’t like being called a NERD, I think he was fine with geek
   though. I’m also an uber NERD and have no problems with either term, of
   course my computer skills aren’t anything spectacular. But having
   worked IT Support once for six months I no longer say I don’t know
   anything because as stupid as it sounds, plunging things in was
   actually a problem I had to fix more than once…

   I’ve never liked either term.

   Although it is mildly amusing that back when I was called those as
   insults, those same people are posting cat pictures on Facebook and
   can’t live without the Internet.
   mrentropy (17206 points )“Great Answer” (2 points )
   Buttonstc's avatar

   This is all giving me a fascinating perspective on all of this
   terminology.

   @mrentropy

   I can certainly understand why you feel as you do about terms which
   were hurled at you as insults.

   Just for curiosity, is there a colliquial appellation that you would
   prefer that could stand in for the rather torturous “person who is
   unusually proficient with computers” ?
   Buttonstc (27602 points )“Great Answer” (0 points )
   Buttonstc's avatar

   @jerv

   That’s an interesting perspective on the diff between the two.

   Do you remember the short-lived but fondly remembered TV program
   “Freaks And Geeks” ?
   Buttonstc (27602 points )“Great Answer” (0 points )
   anartist's avatar

   Neither, if you are into it. As @jerv points out, geek implies
   knowledge [witness Best Buy’s Geek Squad]. It’s a far cry from the
   original meaning of geek, when it was used disparagingly to computer
   buffs [another term]—geek originally meant “A sideshow freak,
   especially a pinhead retard who bit the heads off live chickens” and
   was used to insult non-jock computer buffs/NERD like Bill Gates was as
   a teenager.

   Meaning changed significantly with “he who laughs last laughs longest.”
   Probably because it once was the most offensive, it is now the least
   offensive. It is worn with pride.

   NERD is a label that conjures images of a pocket protectors, broken
   glasses held together with duct tape, and buck teeth. Geek has come to
   mean an otherwise “normal” person who likes nerdy things.

   What a great article that is. Thanks for bringing it to our attention.

   I’m going to repost this link to a gaming site where several of us got
   into a side discussion about children attaching gender stereotypes to
   colors like purple. It then evolved to include careers in computers and
   engineering for women and how expectations are changing.

   (Also one of the women there managed to access about 400 pages of
   computer code related to the inner workings of the game and is
   currently sharung a lot of those insights with all of us. Obviously she
   works in computers.)

   Thanks for this article. Loved it.

Ben Goldacre maps 'nerdy day trips' for geeks

   "I am a very big fan of nerdy day trips," says Ben Goldacre, journalist
   and author, who's built a massive user-generated map of places for
   geeks to go.

   In a post on his blog, he describes how he's a fan of abandoned nuclear
   bunkers, sea forts, victorian racecourses, and narrow-gauge railways
   that take you to a power station. We are too, so we wanted to highlight
   the impressive map that he's put together of nerdy landmarks in
   Britain.

   He built it with the help of Jo Brodie, who compiled all the
   suggestions (coming in through Goldacre's blog comments and

   two hashtags) onto a Google map. You can see that map here, and add
   your own suggestions.

   Goldacre says on his blog: "We really want to gather as many as
   possible of the more obscure ones, the clearing with the abandoned
   factory, a strange earth feature of NERD interest, the terrifying power
   station, the water slide park, and so on. Our fantasy is that on any
   given road trip, you will be able to find a NERD stop somewhere along
   your route, or perhaps even plot out a NERD odyssey across the UK."

   To contribute to the map, either tweet the info and location using the
   #nerdytrips hashtag, or add your destinations directly onto the map.

   When I enter a room of my peers I always go "Wassup NERD?"
   The irony is that in fact, I am the NERD.
   I don't use geek because that is a stupid word.

   I don’t really like the words but I’d say they have different meanings.
   In my brain a NERD is someone who’s very academic and studies a lot
   where are a geek is someone who’s really into something very specific
   such as films, then that would make them a film geek. Don’t know if
   anyone else thinks the same or if this is just my interpretation :lol:

   draw a Venn Diagram ( how nerdy is that ? :teehee: )
   the geek circle and NERD circle intersect. however there are geeks who
   are not NERD and vice-versa. geekiness implies some level of physical
   manifestation of weirdness... typically protruding teeth & thick
   glasses; the key feature of NERD is intellectual obsessiveness.
   both geeks & NERD are definitely non-chadian.

   I say NERD more.
   They both mean the same thing to me, just that Geek sounds a bit more
   offensive - hence why i use NERD.

   "Geek" is a term that has been appropriated by normies who think it's
   hip and trendy to be obsessed with Dr Who and walk around in their
   Harry Potter themed schoolwear.

   Ah, I remember that one. It was the go-to insult for people who
   actually did their homework in years 7-9.

   I use NERD more. Both are terrible descriptions for basically anything
   but I sometimes throw out NERD as a semi-ironic descriptor. Geek as a
   word is just horrible sounding and has no place in the English language
   frankly.

   Our go-to was "keeno"... as if paying attention and wanting to do well
   was, er, a bad thing?

   I never use those words because I see them as insults. The only context
   I ever use them in is when I talk about how people thought I was a NERD
   as a child and made fun of me for it, even though I was not a NERD in
   the first place.

   I don't use them. And they're different.
   Geeks are more into like comics and stuff.
   While NERD are academically smart.
   I mean someone could be both.

   I don’t use either cause I’m not either and I don’t know anyone who is
   a geek or a NERD.
