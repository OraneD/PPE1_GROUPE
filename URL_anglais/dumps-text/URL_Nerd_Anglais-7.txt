   Quiet: The Power of Introverts

Why 'Nerds' Are Unpopular

Could so-called "nerds" be popular if they wanted it badly enough?

   Upon entering middle school, my once-sensible friend Amy suddenly
   wanted us to spend our time sifting through teen magazines and deciding
   which models were pretty. I was utterly perplexed as to why this was
   interesting, but I tried to offer insightful comments on the Bonne Bell
   lip gloss model's peaches-and-cream complexion.

   As the school year wore on, I dutifully learned our junior high's
   byzantine rules of fashion, makeup, and cliquery. But my heart wasn't
   in it, and my friendship with Amy petered out as she ascended the
   middle school hierarchy. Sometimes I wondered whether I could have
   joined her up there, if only I weren't so.. so... serious.

   But of course I had no choice about being serious. I just was. I loved
   the company of the quirky kids who stayed up til 2 a.m. writing bad
   poetry and published it in the school literary magazine. Eventually I
   became the editor of said magazine; I was the official center of an
   off-center tribe.

   I was doing what felt right, but when I saw Amy in the hallways, I
   always felt a pang. Her new life seemed so enviable, at least from a
   distance. She was always laughing and surrounded by smiling, glittery
   friends.

   I thought of all this when I re-read the investor and programmer Paul
   Graham's brilliant and provocative 2003 essay, "Why Nerds Are
   Unpopular." His thesis is that nerds are unpopular because they have
   more important things to think about than seventh-grade personality
   politics. Here he is:

     "...[W]hy are smart kids so consistently unpopular? The answer, I
     think, is that they don't really want to be popular.

     If someone had told me that at the time [I was in school], I would
     have laughed at him. Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable,
     some of them so miserable that they commit suicide. Telling me that
     I didn't want to be popular would have seemed like telling someone
     dying of thirst in a desert that he didn't want a glass of water. Of
     course I wanted to be popular.

     But in fact I didn't, not enough. There was something else I wanted
     more: to be smart. Not simply to do well in school, though that
     counted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or to write
     well, or to understand how to program computers. In general, to make
     great things.

     [But] popularity is not something you can do in your spare time, not
     in the fiercely competitive environment of an American secondary
     school.

     Alberti, arguably the archetype of the Renaissance Man, writes that
     "no art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you
     want to excel in it." I wonder if anyone in the world works harder
     at anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALs
     and neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison. They
     occasionally take vacations; some even have hobbies. An American
     teenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 days a
     year.

     Nerds don't realize this. They don't realize that it takes work to
     be popular. In general, people outside some very demanding field
     don't realize the extent to which success depends on constant
     (though often unconscious) effort...The main reason nerds are
     unpopular is that they have other things to think about. Their
     attention is drawn to books or the natural world, not fashions and
     parties. They're like someone trying to play soccer while balancing
     a glass of water on his head. Other players who can focus their
     whole attention on the game beat them effortlessly, and wonder why
     they seem so incapable...."

   When I searched for photos to go along with this post (I googled
   "popularity images"), I found that all the pictures of popular girls
   depict them with shopping bags, just like the above shot of Alicia
   Silverstone from the movie "Clueless"—thus making Graham's point.

   But I don't totally agree with Graham. I think he downplays social
   skills too much. The ability to navigate tricky social situations with
   ease is, in the end, what high schoolers prize, and it's a substantive
   skill that kids like Amy take with them long after they graduate.
   Others learn this skill later in life, as they mature, and they benefit
   from it too. Those who never acquire it are at a real disadvantage.

   Also, some kids are popular not because they're shallow or
   Machiavellian but because they have a winning combination of warmth,
   freedom from anxiety, and social grace.

   But Graham is right that in high school these are the only skills that
   seem to matter. In the real world, other characteristics count too.
   Know-how. Passion. Curiosity. Empathy. Drive. Serenity. Conscience.
   Follow-through. Independence of mind. Creativity. Love.

   The list goes on and on.

   Here is Graham again:

     "In almost any group of people you'll find hierarchy. When groups of
     adults form in the real world, it's generally for some common
     purpose, and the leaders end up being those who are best at it. The
     problem with most schools is, they have no purpose. But hierarchy
     there must be. And so the kids make one out of nothing.

     We have a phrase to describe what happens when rankings have to be
     created without any meaningful criteria. We say that the situation
     degenerates into a popularity contest. And that's exactly what
     happens in most American schools. Instead of depending on some real
     test, one's rank depends mostly on one's ability to increase one's
     rank. It's like the court of Louis XIV. There is no external
     opponent, so the kids become one another's opponents."

   If your child is not the most popular kid in school, if s/he is more
   self-conscious than smooth, then please! Let him or her know that
   there's a life beyond high school, a vastly different landscape from
   one s/he's ever seen, a place with multiple forms of social currency
   and an endless variety of ways to make oneself useful.

   Do you agree with Paul Graham's ideas on popularity? And do you think
   it's even possible to convince kids that there's a life beyond high
   school? After all, they've never experienced it for themselves.
