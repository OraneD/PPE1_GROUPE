   Let’s talk geek. If I were to take some of the official dictionary
   definition of ‘geek’ and tweek it a little bit to contextualise this
   article…

   Definition of hypnosis geek.

   noun: hypnosis geek; plural noun: hypnosis geeks (like those who listen
   to my podcasts, train with my college and come to my hypnosis geek
   dinners)

   1. A knowledgeable and obsessive enthusiast.
   “a computer geek”
   “a hypnosis geek”

   verb: geek; 3rd person present: geeks; past tense: geeked; past
   participle: geeked; present participle: geeking

   1. Someone who will
   – engage in or discuss hypnosis-related tasks obsessively or with great
   attention to technical and theoretical detail.
   – be or become extremely excited or enthusiastic about a subject,
   typically one of specialist or minority interest.
   “I am totally geeking out over this meta-analysis detailing the
   efficacy of hypnosis as a means of treating dyslexia.“

   I like hypnosis geeks, and consider myself to be one. I am incredibly
   technical and derive great joy from the theoretical and academic debate
   of my subject. I lecture on the detailed workings of hypnosis, have
   written very evidence based books on the subject, I research hypnosis,
   I have a hypnosis podcast, I write a hypnosis blog, I read academic
   papers on the subject and know the research supporting this field very
   well indeed, but importantly, I get excited about it, I love what can
   be done with hypnosis. I think that qualifies me to be a self-titled
   hypnosis geek.

   What actually is a geek in general terms though?

   Geeks are a subculture which is growing more and more prevalent in
   contemporary society: previously bullied and marginalised, thanks to
   shows like The Big Bang Theory, Doctor Who (heck, sci-fi TV and films
   in general) and a change in public perception of a number of qualities
   that are considered desirable in an individual, being a geek is finally
   becoming cool. Though, they are cool also because they are not bothered
   about being cool. Try being a geek to be cool and you simply become a
   hipster, and whether you like twelve-foot-long beards, wearing wooly
   hats during the height of Summer, wearing skinny jeans and lumberjack
   shirts or not, that is not my topic here today.

   Being a geek then, according to research by Imgur, is actually cool in
   today’s world – especially among Millennials. In fact, 60% of the 83
   million Millennials consider themselves geeks compared to just 38% of
   GenXers and Boomers. And, the study also shows that geeks are the
   trendsetters and influencers (84% of geeks say people look to them for
   advice while only 60% of non-geeks say they get asked for advice).
   Although, some places haven’t quite embraced geeks and geek culture
   like others have, now it’s changing. But, more than that, it’s also
   welcome news for all of us who geek-out about our own work—passionately
   probing to innovate, improve, dissect, and lead others to the discovery
   of their best selves (or best elements of their professional field, for
   example).

   One of my favourite quotes is by the actor, writer and comedian, Simon
   Pegg:

   “Being a geek is all about being honest about what you enjoy and not
   being afraid to demonstrate that affection. It means never having to
   play it cool about how much you like something. It’s basically a
   license to proudly emote on a somewhat childish level rather than
   behave like a supposed adult. Being a geek is extremely liberating.”
   Being a geek isn’t something to be ashamed of. It’s something to be
   proud of and most definitely an awesome way to be!  Here are a few
   reasons why this is the case (and please bear in mind this entire
   article is written with a certain degree of tongue-in-cheek, though you
   know as well as I do, that never a truer word is spoken in jest,
   right?):

   1. The geek brain has an innate ability to focus intensely:
   Some may call it ‘obsessive’, but when geeks put their minds to a task
   or subject, they will be able to focus on it like no other group of
   people. It’s the reason geeks can plough through 20 academic papers in
   a single setting, burn through an entire boxset of Breaking Bad in a
   weekend, the reason they keep having to increase the maximum character
   level cap in World of Warcraft, and one of the reasons top tech
   companies are looking for them. Imagine if someone could bring that
   level of laser-like focus to the work that needs to be done, and think
   about how quickly and efficiently any particular project could be
   completed?!

   2. Geeks are defined by their enthusiasm for things:
   “They’re enthusiasts. Not having a life means you get to love things
   with a passion and nobody bothers you about it.” – John Burnside
   In general geeks are inherently enthusiastic about the things they like
   or enjoy. They source props and replicas of the film and TV objects
   they think are awesome, They will wear t-shirts bearing catchphrases
   while they stand in line for hours to meet the creators and stars of
   the shows they watch obsessively, and they will even occasionally dress
   up as characters they love and go to conventions. Still, they will come
   into work every day with that same energy and enthusiasm.

   If you’ve ever been in a training of mine and heard the way I talk
   about the TV show Red Dwarf, then you know that sci-fi geekery is
   another facet of mine.

   3. A geek is surprisingly resilient:
   For some, it may derive from having fun poked at them, or being teased
   about the things they love, but geeks tend to be incredibly resilient
   and able to bounce back from pretty much anything. That’s why they make
   such good community moderators, able to take the ridiculous abuse of
   internet commenters on the chin and laugh at how stupid it is, rather
   than descending into a depressive shame-spiral and being unable to do
   anything for the rest of the day.

   Resilience in part and parcel of being a geek.

   4. The geek ‘Mind Palaces’ are vast and full of knowledge:
   Sure, a lot of the knowledge that fills their Mind Palaces might be
   largely useless pop culture references like the term ‘Mind Palace’
   itself, but along with the focus that allows them to concentrate on
   things like technical detail, academia, video games and comic books
   comes a certain sponge-like quality to their brains. Once they see
   something a few times, they can commit it to memory with a surprising
   degree of accuracy, and secret it away in the storage locker facility
   that is the geek-brain.

   When you love a subject and have a repeated, consistent devotion to it,
   it is so much easier to retain and recall that information.

   5. Geeks are innovators:
   Have you heard about the new social networking site? Or the latest in
   wearable technology? The new iOS update? No? You would have heard about
   it if you were a geek, because geeks love new technology and love
   sharing news and information about it. Follow a geek on Twitter and
   you’ll know all about that stuff weeks before you would have done
   otherwise, usually the moment it’s announced.

   Geeks are usually the ones who have created the latest innovations, and
   geeks are usually pioneering the field that they work within. Whatever
   field you work in or have an interest in, find a geek of that field,
   follow them closely, without stalking them, obviously.

   6. Geeks advocate for the outsider or the uncool:
   Geeks often side with the underdog, or the oppressed and are sort of
   accustomed to being looked upon in unusual ways, made fun of and pushed
   to the edges of society. Because of it, geeks tend to be amazing
   advocates for the outsiders and the “uncool.”

   However, in every field, you want to hear from those on the fringes,
   those that are innovating and those that have an intensive knowledge
   and enthusiasm.

   7. The geek focuses on a person’s strengths and skills, not their
   influence:
   It’s simple for geeks. How much money you have in the bank, how many
   friends you have and how much influence you have just doesn’t matter.
   Those things aren’t a positive or

   In the hypnosis field, hypnotherapists should be looking at and
   learning from academics, neuroscientists, researchers and credible
   sources of education to further their own career, knowledge and skills,
   yet the masses tend to opt for following those who make the most noise,
   or have the loudest voices. This cartoon strip sums it up for me……
   The truth is, all of us are geeks on some level, about something.
   However, Most of us don’t focus our inner geek on utilising some of the
   most obvious, and powerful, paths to turn ideas into game-changing
   success. Here are two critical areas you should explore if you want to
   turn your geeky ideas into results.

   a) Find a Mentor.
   Yes, we can talk about leaders like Gates, Zuckerberg, and Branson. We
   can hold them all in a mentor-ish spotlight to learn all about their
   accomplishments. But, when it comes to finding a true mentor, it’s
   important to personally know the individual well enough that they can
   teach you both the things they did right, and the things they did
   wrong.

   “I’ve failed more than anyone I know,” digital innovator Jay Samit told
   in a recent interview. “There’s great value in failure.” Find a mentor
   that can show you both what you should do, and what you should stop
   doing. Whether you travel across the country or across town, getting
   out of your routine and daily environment can inspire fresh thinking
   and analysis for your inner geek to process. At the very least, be
   around people who can aid the mentoring process and that you can
   progressively learn from. You know the old adage; if you’re the
   cleverest person in the room, you need to change rooms. Go to places
   where you’ll be stretched and have to strive to rise up and meet those
   that are ahead of you.

   b) Explore.
   Rest and relaxation is important to our well-being. But, there’s more
   to holidays than just dipping your toes in the water. Going somewhere
   new, and seeing different things, and the different ways people do
   things leads to unbelievable breakthroughs, sometimes from the most
   unexpected places.

   I don’t just mean this literally. Seek out environments, groups,
   trainings, courses, people and more besides, that starts a journey of
   exploration and discovery for you. Learning, developing and humbly
   wanting to now more is the road of the geek.

   Get lost a few times, and you derive a deeper understanding of the
   area.

   Being a geek used to draw up images of social misfits, awkward
   conversations, and less than attractive personalities. But, that’s not
   the case anymore, as geeks have become the global trendsetters and
   influencers. It’s a welcome message, long-awaited, for many of us. …and
   it’s a club we’re not ashamed to belong to—because if you focus your
   inner-geek on the areas above, success isn’t too far behind.

   Go embrace your inner geek.
