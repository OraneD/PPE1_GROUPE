   Adam J. Ruben strikes a wacky pose atop a fiberglass lion at a mini
   golf course in 1990.

   Adam J. Ruben, a comedian, writer and scientist, has been called a nerd
   for most of his life. Does he fit the bill? Probably.

   He was in the Princeton marching band. He clearly had no qualms about
   wearing suspenders in 1990. He kept an audio diary in seventh grade.
   And today he’s taking his one-man show, “Don’t Beat Me Up: Stories and
   Artifacts from Adolescence” to his high school alma mater, performing
   for the freshmen class while the sophomores and juniors take the PSAT.

   It’s a spoken word performance based off of diaries, poems and other
   documentation of his grade school life as the object of so many
   bullies’ attention.

   The show started out as an act of commiseration with peers, fashioned
   primarily as a comedy. “Most of it is joking about how lame we all were
   and how nerdy we were and looking at it now from this side,” Ruben
   said. But it does expose the pain of growing up in America as a nerd.

   “I don’t think any of the nerds at my school had that one day where
   they stood up to the bully and the bully backed down, like that scene
   in ‘The Christmas Story’ where Ralphie Parker stands up to Scut Farkus
   and starts wailing on him,” Ruben said.

   For Ruben, bullying was something that happened so often he couldn’t go
   to school without being bullied.

   All the advice about dealing with bullying that he was given as a child
   – Kill the bully with kindness because nobody’s been nice to them
   before; If you’re nice to a bully then suddenly they’ll be a gentle
   giant on your side; Make the bully laugh; Ignore the bully, walk away;
   Just be yourself – was never anything that worked, he said.

   “It just isn’t true, and kids realize it isn’t true,” Ruben said. “It’s
   good advice for adults, but for kids ‘be yourself’ doesn’t really
   work.”

   “I end (my show) with sort of a non-conclusion. That it does get better
   when you become an adult. People sort of stop being petty and selfish
   about it, and the bullying really changes character and goes away
   often. But what would I tell an eighth-grader today who’s being bullied
   other than it gets better eventually? I don’t have a good answer.”

   But an interesting meeting at the Wilmington Fringe Festival caught
   Ruben’s attention. A high school student came up to him after the show
   and said, “Yeah, all the advice that you said doesn’t work about
   bullying, they just had an assembly with us and told us all the same
   advice,” Ruben said. “Which is interesting and sad.”

   With so much media attention on America’s culture of bullying and
   tragic tributes to victims of bullying who took their own lives rather
   than continue to be abused by their peers, Ruben sees the ongoing
   acceptance of bullying to be infuriating. Especially so, he said,
   because no good solution to the problem has been found.

   “Society has this expectation that nerds are people to be bullied and
   made fun of,” Ruben said. “I would get mad every time there was a TV
   show that had nerd characters on it and they always had thick glasses
   with tape in the middle and they were in the chess club, and it became
   perfectly OK to make fun of them.

   “It made me very angry because being a nerd was not something that I
   chose, and it was not something that I was proud of, and it was not
   something I could change,” he said.

   The social pressures of being bullied makes nerds turn on one another,
   he said.

   “It’s that need to feel like no matter what, you’re not the very, very
   bottom person. There is someone that you can still be more popular
   than. One kid who is weirder than you, and you make sure that kid is
   your friend because then you don’t look so bad in comparison,” he said.

   “I knew, in high school, I could identify the few kids that I thought
   were less popular than I was. And it sounds horrible. I think that it
   made me feel a little good that no matter what, I was third to last and
   not last.”

   “Don’t Beat Me Up” showcases some of those painful moments in Ruben’s
   life. Like the note he typed on homecoming night in 10th grade.

   “I promised myself that I would master this social thing, I will have
   friends, and I will know that I’ve succeeded if I have a date for
   homecoming,” Ruben said. “I’ll ask somebody, anybody, and I’ll go
   there. I’ll have a date, I’ll be like a normal person.”

   But it didn’t happen. “Homecoming night I went out to dinner with my
   parents, and then came home and was so depressed about it, I went right
   to the basement and I started typing. And I had that document, so I was
   able to read some parts of that,” Ruben said.

   Ruben said he thinks the acceptance of bullying in America comes down
   to the fact that it is still OK, even expected, to make fun of people
   who are not self-aware.

   “In the same way on a TV show that the stupid character is not
   self-aware, and you laugh when the stupid character says something
   stupid, you laugh at the nerd not being self-aware, and saying things
   that may be inappropriately intelligent for the situation or
   inappropriately detailed,” he said.

   It’s a bit of a romantic notion for nerds to believe they are bullied
   because others are jealous of their potential, Ruben said. “I don’t
   think that anyone who picked on me would have traded places with me,”
   he said.

   And now he’s performing his one-hour show in front of a room full of
   high school freshmen whose reaction to his nerdy confessions is
   unpredictable.

   “I’m not even sure they can sit still and watch an entire play for that
   long.”
