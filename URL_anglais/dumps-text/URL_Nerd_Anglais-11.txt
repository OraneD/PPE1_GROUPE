Why nerds rule the world

   At age 16 I was a member of my school's titration team. That is all the
   information you need to roughly gauge how well I got on with girls. And
   bullies. And girls who were bullies. I didn't do well with any section
   of the girl-bully Venn diagram. But it was those experiences that made
   me what I am today.

   While the ability to accurately measure the concentration of chemical
   solutions in a competitive environment is not a skill I now use
   everyday, I definitely use other skills I developed at the same time.
   You cannot explain to your peers that you're off to the chemistry
   department for a practice session without developing all forms of
   survival tactics. Ed Miliband recently admitted that he was a bit of a
   square in his youth, and specialised in solving the Rubik's Cube. You
   cannot walk around with a Rubik's Cube in a north London comprehensive
   school without honing some serious fast-talking skills that will come
   in handy during a later political career.

   School is ironically a difficult place to be nerdy. The school yard
   does not take anything into account other than your image and your
   physical ability (sadly, not your physics ability). These are not areas
   where nerds excel, so to make it through these dark years, generations
   of geeks have developed all manner of coping strategies that have
   served them very well later in life. For the school bully, secondary
   school graduation is the high point of their life; for the nerd, it's
   the beginning of their life.

   I've taught maths in inner London comprehensives and they are full of
   kids having a rough time who will undoubtedly succeed in the rest of
   their life. I remember looking at the members of the maths club and
   thinking "you've just got to make it through these few years and then
   you'll be all right".

   Nerds are the richest people in the world. Do not even start on how
   much elite sports people are paid. Sure, Rooney is one of the highest
   paid footballers in the world at £250,000 per week, but the guys who
   founded Google are worth £9.4bn each. Even if he played all 52 weeks in
   a year, Rooney would need to have started playing football in about the
   year 1288 to now be worth that much (around the same year that William
   of Ockham was born, for you history fans). He also has to sweat a lot.
   The Google kids probably just had to put up with a bit of bullying at
   school before writing some clever computing code.

   Nerds are also the most powerful. It should come as no surprise that
   our political leaders were a bit square at school. I hope they are
   still a bit square now. Our political and security service halls of
   power are not staffed by the kids who could punch well at school and
   kick a ball a long way (and throw said ball into a thing, or hit it
   with a stick – I forget the details), they're staffed by the kids who
   could wear a Star Trek T-shirt on mufti day and survive.

   The pattern continues in the world of entertainment. The cool kids you
   went to school with now sit at home watching endless repeats of Mock
   The Week on Dave, which is hosted by Dara O Briain with his maths
   degree and stocked with comics who were all the nerdy kids at school.
   There's nothing like a lack of physical prowess to encourage the
   development of lightning fast wit.

   So, nerdy kids the world over, let the cool kids have the first
   quintile of life and all the spoils from the top of the school yard
   food-web. From graduation onwards, your intelligence and studiousness
   will grant you money, power and success. You may even end up as leader
   of the opposition; waiting quietly to be prime minister so you can have
   those bullies from school quietly taken care of.
