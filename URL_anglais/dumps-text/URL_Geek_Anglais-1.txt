Jodrell Bank, Cheshire

   This is more than just the backdrop to the BBC’s Stargazing Live,
   Jodrell Bank is home to the Lovell Telescope and is a centre for
   world-class science. This is ground zero for a project linking six
   other UK-based radio telescopes into a dish array spanning 134 miles
   and is headquarters for the €1.5bn Square Kilometre Array, comprising
   thousands of radio receptors across Australia and eight countries in
   southern Africa. Bernard Lovell started radio astronomy here in the
   1940s, using a collection of army surplus radar kit he hauled out to
   the gardens of the University of Manchester. More than 60 years on, his
   name-scape remains the world’s third-biggest moveable telescope, a
   combination of 3,200 tonnes of metal and railway bogey.
   Adult £6.30, child £4.50, family ticket from £20. Open daily 10am-5pm,
   jodrellbank.net

Air Radar Defence Museum, Norfolk

   Control desk and panels at Air Radar Defence Museum, Norfolk

   The Air Radar Defence Museum occupies the site of the world’s longest,
   continuously operating radar installation. RAF Neatishead was a key
   link in the radar chain deployed successfully against the Luftwaffe
   during the second world war and scanned the waves for incoming attacks.
   It’s possible to poke at the same equipment RAF operators used to
   detect hostile blips building three-dimensional scans using left and
   right controls and view, in real-time, the maelstrom that is civilian
   air space over the UK today. There’s other technical gear here, too: a
   section of one of those radar golf ball shields, beautifully intricate
   electronic valves, the cockpit of a Jaguar ground-attack aircraft, and
   a disarmed Bristol Bloodhound surface-to-air missile.
   Adult £10, child £5, family ticket £25. Open Tues, Thurs and bank
   holiday Mondays, April to November and the second Saturday of each
   month, 10am-5pm, radarmuseum.co.uk

The National Museum of Computing, Milton Keynes

   The National Museum of Computing History keeps the bits and bytes of
   old computers alive while celebrating those no longer with us. It
   houses some of the world’s oldest, rarest and best-remembered systems:
   rooms of BBC Micros, a NeXT – created by Steve Jobs and used by Tim
   Berners-Lee to “invent” the web; a 2.5-tonne calculator called the
   Harwell Dekatron, which is the world’s oldest working digital computer
   following four years of renovation. This was also part of Bletchley
   Park, where mathematicians, engineers and the military worked to crack
   encrypted messages during the second world war. And you can see a
   replica of Colossus, the room-size machine used to break the cyphers.
   Adult £7.50, concessions £5, family ticket £20. Collosus Galleries open
   daily from 10.30am-5pm; full museum open Thurs, Sat and Sun from
   12pm-5pm, tnmoc.org

Kelvedon Hatch Secret Nuclear Bunker, Essex

   Walls of concrete 3.5m-thick, and reinforced using tungsten rods set on
   shock absorbers and resting on a 60m bed of gravel all topped by … a
   bungalow – yes, welcome to Kelvedon Hatch, an absurdist chapter in the
   UK’s cold war story. Kelvedon was an early warning system built,
   rapidly, under the Rotor programme, following Russia’s successful test
   of a nuclear bomb and deployment of heavy bomber aircraft capable of
   reaching the UK during the early 1950s. Kelvedon was a network of
   bunkers into which hundreds of government and military personnel were
   to have retreated following a nuclear attack, in order to keep running
   Britain. The place is, by turns, frightening, impressive and saddening:
   testimony to a disappeared stiff-upper-lip world; there are
   communications rooms that contain telexes and red telephones, desks
   dedicated to government departments, even a suite for the BBC to keep
   broadcasting to those above ground.
   Adult £7, child £5, family ticket £16.50. Open, March-October, daily
   10am-5pm; November-February open Thurs-Sun 10am-4pm,
   secretnuclearbunker.com

Crossness Pumping Station, London

   At Crossness you’ll find the Victorian development that helped
   transform London into a modern city. It is an interconnected system
   involving a six-acre reservoir capable of holding 27 million gallons,
   sewers and massive pumps that stopped the river Thames being a
   stinking, open cesspit. Crossness was the work of civil engineer Joseph
   Bazalgette and his creation bursts with civic Victorian pride: a visit
   to the massive engines at Crossness reveals a hall that’s more church
   then engine room, boasting ironwork of such intricacy and painted
   detail that you soon forget this was a sewage plant.
   Adult £8, child £2. Open Tues and Fri 9.30-4pm and on the second Sunday
   of the month 9.30am-4pm; see website for exact dates and details,
   crossness.org.uk

Cruachan Power Station, Argyll and Bute

   The Cruachan hydroelectric power station was the world’s first
   reversible-turbine power station – and it was built into a mountain.
   Everything about Cruachan is epic: surveyed in 1921, construction only
   began in 1959 and took two years thanks to poor weather and the remote
   location. The loch that feeds Cruachan didn’t exist before 1959, it’s
   manmade and dammed using 200,000 tonnes of concrete. The loch’s waters
   flow into an aqueduct and tunnels feeding down into a cavernous machine
   room housing four turbines. This facility was blasted and mined by more
   than 1,300 workers housed locally and known as the Tunnel Tigers.
   Health and safety? Thirty-six died digging out the cavern, tunnels and
   aqueducts and are commemorated in a carved tribute.
   Visitor centre free, guided tours adult £7, child £2.50. April-October
   open daily 9.30am-4.45pm; November-March open Mon-Fri 10am-3.45pm,
   visitcruachan.co.uk

Hursley Park, Hampshire

   IBM bought the 16th-century Hursley House in the 1950s as postwar
   global demand for computers increased. IBM’s answer to this was the
   mainframe. One of 43 IBM innovation centres, Hursley has been
   instrumental in the development of the company’s most important
   software, as well as advancements in displays and disk-based storage.
   Hursley is home to IBM’s CICS MQ Series software that – in many cases –
   runs transactions on the mainframe system that underpins your retail
   bank, and ensures you can withdraw cash from you account via an ATM.
   Museum not open to the public but group visits can be arranged,

The Lizard Wireless Station, Marconi Centre and Wireless Field, Cornwall

   This part of the UK was a hub in the communications revolution.
   Guglielmo Marconi didn’t invent wireless but, working here at the dawn
   of the 20th century, he unlocked its potential. Before he moved on to
   Canada, Marconi worked in a shed near the Lizard village and then in a
   purpose-built facility at Poldhu. That shed survives as a Grade
   II-listed building, overseen by the National Trust. Poldhu Cove, from
   where Marconi generated a signal powerful enough to reach North America
   for the first time, is gone – but a set of foundations and ruins marks
   its spot. From these ruins has sprung the Marconi Centre museum that is
   home to radio rooms used by the Poldhu Amateur Radio Club and open to
   visiting licensed operators.
   Suggested donation £1pp. 22 March-30 October open Tues, Thurs and Fri
   noon-3pm, lizardwireless.org

James Clerk Maxwell House and Foundation, Edinburgh

   James Clerk Maxwell is essential to physics as we understand it today.
   Maxwell posited the existence of radio waves laying the foundation of
   wireless decades later; proved pictures shot through different colour
   filters could be combined to create a single colour image, setting in
   stone the concept of RGB (red, green and blue); and proved
   mathematically that the rings of Saturn could be made of neither solid
   nor liquid but were comprised of rocks. All that, and Maxwell was a
   poet. Number 14 India Street in Edinburgh was Maxwell’s birthplace and
   you can tour this slice of early 19th-century Georgiana – built as
   Britain turned from thoughts of war and how to defeat Napoleon
   Bonaparte to breaking the frontiers of science.
   Open by appointment, tours usually available Mon-Fri 10am-12pm and
   2.30pm-5pm, clerkmaxwellfoundation.org

Spaceguard Centre, Powys

   Spaceguard Centre, Powys

   Spaceguard is the inspiration of one man: Jonathan Tate. It is part of
   a global effort to track Near Earth Objects (NEOs): 100-150 tonnes of
   material hits the Earth’s atmosphere every day, most of it harmless
   dust, but some have had bigger impacts: the 2013 meteorite over
   Chelyabinsk that injured 1,600, the 1908 Tunguska event in Siberia that
   levelled hundreds of square miles of forest. Spaceguard houses two
   large, robotically controlled telescopes, used by Tate to confirm other
   people’s NEO spots. A tour of this one-man outpost high in Powys, with
   Tate, takes in telescopes, fragments – including bits from Chelyabinsk
   – and enough data to ensure it won’t just be the younger members of
   your party who leave wide eyed.
   Adult £7, child £4. Tours operate May-Sept, Wed-Sun at 10.30am, 2pm and
   4pm; Oct-Apr at 2pm and 4pm, spaceguardcentre.com
