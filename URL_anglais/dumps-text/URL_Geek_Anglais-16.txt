   May 25, 2011 -- It is a rivalry that has stood the test of time,
   tortured many a high school souls and become an iconic battle in U.S.
   culture: jocks vs. geeks. Today, on International Geek Pride Day, a new
   survey reveals that geeks are winning the public opinion war.

   Fifty-seven percent of Americans say being called a geek is a
   compliment and more Americans would prefer to be called a geek rather
   than a jock, according to a new survey by Modis.

   "People have gone from the vision of the movies 'Revenge of the Nerds'
   and that was what geeks would be associated with being, to Bill Gates,
   Steve Jobs, considered pretty cool people," said Jack Cullen, president
   of Modis, a provider of information technology staffing. "I point a lot
   of it towards the coolness of Apple and what they've done to bring
   everybody into the forefront of the digital world."

   The survey also reveals that Americans closely associate the word
   "geek" with positive attributes such as intelligence and an expertise
   in technology.

   Despite the good will, however, there is a generational divide.
   Sixty-six percent of those 18 to 34 consider being identified as a
   "geek" a compliment, while only 39 percent of those 65 and older agree.

   "The association was if you're technically savvy and you're really into
   technology you're tucked away in a corner somewhere and you're nerdy,"
   Cullen said. "You got the pen protector, the white tape over your
   glasses and you're a social outcast. Now you're the coolest guy in the
   room."

   The atmosphere for geeks in America is changing overall. The vast
   majority, 82 percent of people, believe it is more acceptable to be a
   geek today than it was 15 years ago.

   But whatever you do, don't get geeks and nerds confused. The survey
   showed that people do not see the words synonymously. Self-identified
   geeks make up 17 percent of Americans and 87 percent of those who
   self-identified as a geek prefer the term over nerd.

   "Being geek signifies intelligence and coolness," Cullen told ABC News.
   "In the old days it always stood for intelligence, but intelligence
   wasn't always that important and I think there's also a different level
   here of intelligence. The expectation isn't that your this Mensa. The
   expectation is that you understand, embrace and use technology
   everyday.

   "Not only has technology changed our lives and how we use technology,
   but how the perceptions of people have changed as well."
