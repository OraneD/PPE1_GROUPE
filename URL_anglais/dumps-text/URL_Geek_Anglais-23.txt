Geeks throughout the ages

   author details Connor Dunster Culture March 17, 2014
   Header image for Interrobang article
   Geeks are not a new phenomenon — they've been around for decades! Take
   a look at how geeks have changed.
   1920s
   “The word ‘geek' originates from the Latin word geck, which means ‘a
   fool or freak,'” Brahm Wiseman from Heroes Comics (186 Dundas St.)
   explained. The word was first used in the 1920s to describe circus
   sideshow acts that would perform bizarre acts like biting the heads o
   of small animals and eating live insects.
   1950s
   In the '50s, “geek” was adopted into post-World War II slang, and came
   to mean “a person who is extremely interested and knowledgeable about
   computers, electronics, technology, and gadgets.” Geeks often worked as
   engineers and scientists, developing these machines out of pure
   passion.
   By now, this word had planted its roots firmly into culture and its
   meaning would continue to be shaped for years to come.
   1960s
   By the 1960s, the word geek was starting to gain popularity in pop
   culture. It was not only used to describe someone interested in
   technology, but its meaning had expanded to include anyone who was
   intelligent, especially in the fields of math and science. Geeks were
   infiltrating college campuses and starting their own academic clubs and
   fraternities. They were seen now as the short-sleeved shirted,
   pocket-protector wearing, comic book reading, asthma-puer inhaling,
   four-eyed classic geeks that are parodied in countless television shows
   and movies.
   1970s
   The show Happy Days had huge influence on popularizing the word geek,
   using it many times to pick on their nerdier friend and describe the
   uncool kids.
   By now, geeks were getting much more involved in hobbies like trading
   cards, tabletop games and fantasy novels to transport them to other
   lands. It was a great time for geek culture: Dungeons and Dragons was
   released in 1974 and Star Trek and Star Wars were released to a massive
   following of geek fans. Geeks began dressing up as their favourite
   characters and snapping up all the action figures, lunchboxes other
   memorabilia they could get their hands on. Now, the word shifted its
   meaning again, and now included any geek who had a strong passion for
   science fiction.
   1980s
   Geek culture was at an all-time high in the '80s, and for the first
   time, much of geek culture was embraced by others.
   Video games started to become very popular during this time, and from
   this came a new kind of geek: the gamer. Geeks began filling up
   arcades, spending an allowance's worth of quarters and buying the
   newest Atari and Nintendo systems to play at home. The geeks' new pride
   was being the guy who mastered the game and had their high scores
   posted in magazines.
   With computers slowly becoming readily available in middle-class
   households, geeks were trying their hand at mastering these machines.
   Movies like WarGames, Ferris Bueller's Day O and Weird Science showed
   average teens as “hackers,” breaking into secure government databases,
   changing their grades and, somehow, creating women. People began to
   emulate these computer whizzes and the computer geek was born.
   1990s
   At this point, computers were no longer just huge paperweights; they
   were becoming much more complex. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Steve
   Wozniack were busy designing their Microsoft and Apple products,
   showing the world the full potential of what computers could do. These
   geeks broke away from the white-collar approach to working on
   computers, having long hair and wearing flip-flops and shorts year
   round. They took the industry by storm, making millions of dollars very
   quickly and are considered pioneers in the field, dubbed the Pirates of
   Silicon Valley. Many geeks realized the future was in computers and
   started getting jobs in website design and IT.
   With the Internet boom, Geeks were not only making tons of money, but
   also sharing ideas and swapping information on message boards and
   forums. People being able to talk to each other across the globe gave
   way for music and movie geeks, who could discuss their favorite albums
   and films online.
   Geeks now
   “Geeks were seen as sociably acceptable” beginning in the 2000s,
   according to Wiseman, and they have become the driving force behind
   modern life. Everything from your o�ce to your home is run daily by
   computers, which rely on geeks to develop and maintain them.
   Now, geekdom has become an inescapable part of our culture: many
   average people have chosen a side in the Mac vs. PC war and will defend
   it proudly; superhero movies rake in millions of dollars at the box
   o�ce on a regular basis; and online role-playing games like World of
   Warcraft and Call of Duty are drawing players from around the world.
   You might even call ‘hipsters' the newest evolution of the geek. They
   wear the “geek chic” look, including thick glasses and quirky outfits,
   and snag the newest technology as soon as it comes out. They're
   interested in obscure culture, trying to find movies and music that are
   far away from the mainstream before anyone hears about it.
   The word (geek) is no longer considered an insult; it's used to
   describe someone who has a passion for a particular interest. “The word
   has been distinguished over the years as something that is quite cool,”
   said Wiseman.
