Dr. Sonja Falck claims calling someone ‘nerd’ or ‘geek’ should be a hate
crime

     Should branding someone a 'nerd' be made a hate crime?

     have negative effects that last a lifetime, while @Bobby_Seagull

   A British psychotherapist stirred up a social media squabble Thursday
   when she suggested on national TV that calling someone a “nerd” or
   “geek” should be considered a hate crime.

   Dr. Sonja Falck, also a psychology lecturer at the University of East
   London, appeared on “Good Morning Britain” alongside Bobby Seagull, a
   mathematician, teacher and writer who describes himself as a “proud
   geek.”

   On the program, Falck suggested that ridiculing someone with those two
   terms — and others like “brainiac” and “egghead” — should have legal
   consequences.

   “I think people find it startling because very high IQ people are a
   minority group in society who are very much ignored, they’re not
   understood and largely neglected,” she said. “It is the case that very
   high IQ people very often are bullied at school, for example. They’re a
   target for being bullied quite viciously.”

   In response, Seagull argued that today, many view the “geek” label as a
   badge of honor.

   “While the term geek and nerd has historically been seen as being
   negative, people have now embraced the term and seen it as positive,”
   he explained. “I think with geeks and nerds, if you see it as a
   negative thing, it could be negative, but if you embrace it, actually
   to be a geek means a good thing.”

   Still, Falck emphasized that “neurodiversity” — or the differences in
   people’s brains — “is an aspect of individual difference, which really
   ought to be recognized by society.”

   “If you look at those legislations that relate to hate crimes, hate
   crime is simply about somebody being targeted in a negative way for who
   they are,” she said. “And a person with a very high IQ who comes across
   in a different way often is targeted in that way. So I just think
   [it’s] an individual difference that should be respected.”

   Commenters on the “Good Morning Britain” Twitter page largely shot down
   Falck’s argument.

   “I think the ‘nerd’ and the ‘geek’ have taken ownership of these words,
   flipping from negative to positive,” one user wrote. “Geek chic is a
   ‘thing,’ people want to be them now, if someone attempts to use that as
   an insult today it is laughable. It’s not ‘hate crime’, it’s a
   compliment!”

   “Let’s make every insult a hate crime,” another person commented.
   “Better build a hundred prisons more. Stupidity is dangerous.”
