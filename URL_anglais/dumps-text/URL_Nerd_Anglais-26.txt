   and it was developed to objectively quantify nerdiness.

   If you find yourself at Comic-Con holding hands with your bespectacled,
   Bill Nye-loving pre-teen while they chat away in fluent Klingon, you
   may have a nerdy kid on your hands. And, let’s face it, there are worse
   things. You may even get out of paying for college. But your nerdy kid
   might suffer for their proclivities as well. Kids aren’t getting
   stuffed into lockers at quite the same rate they used to, but children
   with esoteric interests and quick minds often find themselves
   ostracized. All the more reason to keep a close eye on your spawn’s
   nerd-dom. And the more reason to have them take this psychometric test
   for nerdiness.

   Yes, there’s a real test. Yes, it’s legit. Yes, it’s weird that it
   exists.

   The psychometric test in question is called The Nerdy Personality
   Attributes Scale, and it was developed to objectively quantify
   nerdiness. (We assume the scientists who designed the scale scored
   very, very high.) Since “nerd” is essentially an objective social
   label, designing the test involved surveying a very large pool of nerds
   and asking them which personality attributes they possess. In other
   words, the scale can estimate how similar your child’s personality is
   to that of the average person who identifies as a nerd. It’s shockingly
   instructive.

Meet The Nerdy Personality Attributes Scale

   Ask your child to answer the following 26 questions with either
   Disagree (1), Neutral (3), or Agree (5). The average score is 50. Any
   higher than that—and your kid might just be a nerd.
    1. I like to play RPGs. (ex. D&D)
    2. I was in advanced classes.
    3. I am interested in science.
    4. I like science fiction.
    5. I spend more time at the library than any other public place.
    6. I am more comfortable with my hobbies than I am with other people.
    7. I have started writing a novel.
    8. I love to read challenging material.
    9. I sometimes prefer fictional people to real ones.
   10. I can be socially awkward at times.
   11. I was a very odd child.
   12. I would describe my smarts as bookish.
   13. I watch science-related shows.
   14. I get excited about my ideas and research.
   15. I like to read technology news reports.
   16. I prefer academic success to social success.
   17. I am a strange person.
   18. I gravitate towards introspection.
   19. I collect books.
   20. I enjoy learning more than I need to.
   21. I have played a lot of video games.
   22. I care about super heroes.
   23. I would rather read a book than go to a party.
   24. My appearance is not as important as my intelligence.
   25. I am more comfortable interacting online than in person.
   26. I spend recreational time researching topics others might find dry
       or overly rigorous.

Well, You Have A Nerdy Kid. Now What?

   First, rejoice. Some of the greatest minds (not to mention
   billionaires) would have scored pretty darn high on the Nerdiness
   Scale, too. But with great nerdiness comes great responsibility.
   Because of your nerdy kid’s dispositions, studies suggest they may be
   more likely to be bullied.

   In small doses, a little ribbing isn’t worth worrying about. But if the
   bullying becomes sustained and starts affecting your child’s emotional
   health, you may have to intervene. Besides speaking to teachers and
   adults who can control potential bullies, experts suggest promoting
   positive body language in order to make your child a less inviting
   target, coaching your kid to walk away from confrontation, and
   rehearsing appropriate responses to bullies.

   There are also studies that suggest some natural-born nerds —
   especially young women — intentionally underperform in school so as not
   to be perceived as nerdy. It would be a tragedy to see your math whiz
   flunk calculus due to social pressures, so make sure to reinforce the
   nerdiness at home. There’s nothing uncool about a free ride to college.
   Right, dad?
