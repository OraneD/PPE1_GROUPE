   Being a nerd is pretty cool.

   Even Mark Zuckerberg agrees, encouraging girls to*be* the nerd rather
   than just date them.

   But if you’re already a nerd, than that’s no news to you. Long have you
   been talking about the new Star Wars and despairing at the long wait
   for the new A Song of Ice and Fire book.

   I mean, now we know it won’t be finished before April, what are we all
   going to do when the new Game of Thrones series comes out and ruins it
   all?!

   giphy (15)

   Yeah. Basically.

   All that panic aside, there are a lot of reasons why being a nerd is
   just the best.

   Here are just 13 of them.

   (If you’re not sure how nerdy you are, we have a quiz for that.)

1) You probably have a higher than average IQ

   giphy (17)

   Well, with an interest in maths, physics and/or literature, it just
   comes part of the package.

   Nothing better than challenging people to a game of ‘how many places of
   pi can you remember’. Am I right?

2) You have a large variety of interests

   Sci-fi, fantasy, games – the nerd universe has no shortage of niches
   you can geek out to.

   It’s particularly fun when the things you like, superheroes for
   example, get really popular all of a sudden. You can either feel smug
   about being ahead of the curve or it’s your turn to shine with endless
   knowledge about it.

3) And you’re hugely passionate about them

   giphy (18)

   I mean, what fun is it being all ‘meh’ about everything in life anyway?

   No one else may like Star Trek but you will find great joy in loving
   every episode of it.

   And that passion can spill over into other areas of your life when you
   find someone who shares them, if you know what I mean.

4) And you’re not as anti-social as everyone thinks

   Comic-Con, anyone? If its existence proves anything, it’s that there’s
   a massive community of like-minded people out there to actively
   socialise with.

   Thousands of nerds literally attend these things. Thousands.

5) And even when on your own…you’re never alone

   giphy (19)

   If there’s one place you know your fellow nerds will be, it’s the
   internet. There’s nothing more fun than giggling together over anime
   memes.

   It really does bring people together.

6) You never have to play it cool

   As Simon Pegg once said, being a geek ‘means never having to play it
   cool about how much you like something’. You can profuse your love for
   Star Wars or Doctor Who and never have a fear of what people think of
   you.

   It’s liberating to be so comfortable in your own skin.

7) We rule and change the world

   giphy (20)

   From Bill Gates to Mark Zuckerberg himself, nerds have been powerful
   movers and shakers in this world.

   I mean, just take a look at what happens if Facebook goes
   down…*shiver*… the world would be saying goodbye to its Tinder and
   Instagram selfies.

8) You have the thickest skin

   giphy (16)

   You were probably the weird one at school who was teased for playing
   Pokemon in the corner of the playground instead of playing football.

   No matter how many insults were thrown your way and or how many of your
   Yu-Gi-Oh cards were hidden though, your nerdy ways were never going to
   change.

   It was tough, but those bullies were not your kryptonite – and you’re
   so much stronger as a result.

9) You are ace at pub quizzes

   You knew that photographic memory and deep interest in niche genres
   of electronic music would come handy one day.

   Intro round? Easy. Tricky politics questions? No problem. You were born
   for this.

10) You’re a good problem solver

   giphy (21)

   Nerds will happily spend hours trying to work their way through a level
   in a game or untangle huge amounts of complicated code.

   You’re not afraid of getting yourself right up to your elbows into a
   messy situation.

11) Halloween is just the best

   From your favourite superhero, to an infamous villain – there’s just so
   much to choose from for one of your favourite holiday.

   You always have a great costume idea. Or, y’know, a million.

12) You’re naturally competitive

   BH5Xi

   ‘You’ve a level 76 Breton with great sword skills on Skyrim? WELL… You
   should see my level 80 magic-wielding Dark Elf.’

   And it’s that competitive spirit guides you in many other areas in life
   – from your academic record, to your work ethic.

   A guaranteed hard-worker, you could say.

13) You’re very friendly and accepting… of everyone

   Being weird is a fundamental part of being a nerd, so you’re very
   accepting everyone’s odd little ticks.

   We’re just one big nerdy family really.
