Nerd vs. geek: How an insult became a compliment

   Now might just be the best time in history to be a geek or a nerd. How
   have the definitions and connotations changed over time?

   Are you a geek or a nerd? Maybe you don’t want to admit it, but chances
   are you may have some qualities of both in you. But what is the real
   difference between the two terms?
     __________________________________________________________________

   ‘Geek’ comes to us from history, being a term coined all the way back
   in the 1500s. At that time, it was reserved for a person thought to be
   a fool. Another possibility is that it comes from the 18th-century word
   ‘gecken’ used during the reign of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where it
   referred to circus performers who specialized in biting heads off live
   chickens.

   Fast-forward to the 1950s and the word geek came to mean what it
   essentially does today, designating someone who is very passionately
   into technology or certain sub-cultures. You can have academic geeks,
   computer geeks, film geeks, Star Wars geeks, video game geeks, food and
   fashion geeks and so forth. Geeks gather collections of objects, facts,
   and mementos related to their obsessive interests, as Big Think wrote
   previously. Geeks can also fix things for you, a fact used by the
   retailer Best Buy in naming its repair division the Geek Squad.

   A ‘nerd’ could be similarly passionate but focused on achievement over
   collecting, preferring to gain knowledge and skills rather than trivia.
   One fun bit of trivia, however: the term nerd was invented by none
   other than the beloved children’s author Dr. Seuss in 1950 when he
   wrote, “A nerkle, a nerd, and a seersucker too!” in his book If I Ran
   the Zoo.

   In 1951, a Newsweek article pointed out that the term started to become
   popular as a synonym for a “drip” or a “square” in Detroit, Michigan.
   The usage of the word just spread from there, entering popular culture
   in the 1970s when it was frequently used on the TV sitcom Happy
   Days—the one with Fonzie.

   Here’s how Slackpropagation differentiates between geeks and nerds:

     “Both are dedicated to their subjects, and sometimes socially
     awkward. The distinction is that geeks are fans of their subjects,
     and nerds are practitioners of them.”

   While geeks can have certain cool factors, nerds tend to be thought of
   as overly intellectual and often perceived to be lacking in social
   graces. As a result, more people would admit to being geeks than nerds.
   Still, like geeks, modern nerds have reclaimed some measure of pride in
   what was once a more decidedly negative term with the nerds of Silicon
   Valley, in particular, finding that the qualities that once had some
   laughing at them could actually earn them millions (and for some,
   billions).

   Kory Stamper, a lexicographer at Merriam-Webster Dictionary and a Big
   Think contributor, explains how the terms have been reappropriated. She
   explains that ‘nerd’ refers to someone with a depth of knowledge in a
   specific field or topic—making her a true word nerd—while geek now
   denotes a technical know-how, a brainy group that is good at
   technology.

     “There was a dip in its usage for a while before becoming more
     popular as more people started learning html and building their own
     websites,” wrote Stamper. “It came back in the mid-1990s, when it
     was still being used disparagingly. There was a slow shift and by
     the 2000s, it began to register a neutral sense.”

   It also bears saying that one of the most popular shows of the past
   decade has been The Big Bang Theory, which celebrates both nerds and
   geeks. This is a clear example of Slackpropagation’s definition: The
   Big Bang Theory is a show about nerds, made for geeks. The show makes
   gentle fun of its heroes, who fit most of the stereotypes ascribed to
   these words, but it also helps them become understandable and beloved
   by a massive audience around the world.

   Also of note is that you will now find more people calling themselves
   nerds or geeks than ever before, signifying the cultural transformation
   of these concepts. Many people are now ready to “own their nerd-dom,”
   as noted by author Neil Gaiman.

   So which one are you, a geek or a nerd?
