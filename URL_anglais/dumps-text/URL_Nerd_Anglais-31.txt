   I rarely use either. They have mostly been co-opted by dullards that
   are neither.

   When I enter a room of my peers I always go "Wassup nerds?"
   The irony is that in fact, I am the nerd.
   I don't use geek because that is a stupid word.

   I don’t really like the words but I’d say they have different meanings.
   In my brain a nerd is someone who’s very academic and studies a lot
   where are a geek is someone who’s really into something very specific
   such as films, then that would make them a film geek. Don’t know if
   anyone else thinks the same or if this is just my interpretation :lol:

   draw a Venn Diagram ( how nerdy is that ? :teehee: )
   the geek circle and nerd circle intersect. however there are geeks who
   are not nerds and vice-versa. geekiness implies some level of physical
   manifestation of weirdness... typically protruding teeth & thick
   glasses; the key feature of nerds is intellectual obsessiveness.
   both geeks & nerds are definitely non-chadian.

   I say Nerd more.
   They both mean the same thing to me, just that Geek sounds a bit more
   offensive - hence why i use Nerd.

   "Geek" is a term that has been appropriated by normies who think it's
   hip and trendy to be obsessed with Dr Who and walk around in their
   Harry Potter themed schoolwear.

   Ah, I remember that one. It was the go-to insult for people who
   actually did their homework in years 7-9.

   I use nerd more. Both are terrible descriptions for basically anything
   but I sometimes throw out nerd as a semi-ironic descriptor. Geek as a
   word is just horrible sounding and has no place in the English language
   frankly.

   Our go-to was "keeno"... as if paying attention and wanting to do well
   was, er, a bad thing?

   I never use those words because I see them as insults. The only context
   I ever use them in is when I talk about how people thought I was a nerd
   as a child and made fun of me for it, even though I was not a nerd in
   the first place.

   I don't use them. And they're different.
   Geeks are more into like comics and stuff.
   While nerds are academically smart.
   I mean someone could be both.
