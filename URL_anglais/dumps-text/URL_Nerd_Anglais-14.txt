   UFC commentator Joe Rogan revealed why he thinks “nerd” is no longer
   used as an insult during his latest podcast with Lex Fridman.

   Joe Rogan has built a massive following from his popular podcast, the
   Joe Rogan Experience, where he covers a wide range of interesting
   topics.

   During his April 8 episode alongside MIT research scientist, Lex
   Fridman, the pair found themselves in a rather unusual debate,
   discussing if “nerd” is still used as an insult in modern times.

   changed in recent years.

   After watching a short clip of Bill Gates making a jump over a chair
   during his show, the podcast host remarked that it was “a pretty good
   jump for a nerd,” which sparked the debate between himself and Fridman.

   Lex revealed his take on the term, expressing that he hated the use of
   it and viewed it as a saying that would often be used to describe
   someone in a negative manner, before asking, “you don’t think of a nerd
   as an ideal of a man?”

   Joe, on the other hand, believed that the days of “nerd” being used as
   an insult had passed, and explained that he would use the word to
   describe someone who had invested a lot of energy into a particular
   subject.

   “There’s nothing wrong with nerds, no I disagree, like I’m a nerd about
   a lot of things,” he replied, pointing towards “dork” as the term that
   is rarely used in a positive light, instead.

   “It’s very rare that dork is positive, whereas nerd is often positive.
   Nerd is like a fun way about saying someone is really smart about a
   certain thing,” he explained.

   Joe later admitted that he understood where Lex was coming from, and
   added that the way to dismantle the stereotype would be to introduce a
   positive culture of celebrating those who invest their life in science.

   the perception around those choosing careers in science.

   “I don’t think the way around that is to eliminate words or even stop
   using words, I think the way around it is just to appreciate people
   that are really great at science. The words don’t really matter, it’s
   perceptions that matter and I don’t think science has a bad perception,
   it just doesn’t have a glamorous enough perception,” Joe added.

   One of the main issues the pair highlighted before moving on was the
   fact that “nerds” would often play a part in worsening the perception
   by deciding against activities that didn’t fit the stereotype, such as
   working out or becoming fight fans.

   Although the term “nerd” has not always been associated with
   positivity, many would claim that the perception has changed in recent
   years particularly with tech stars such as Elon Musk inspiring many to
   appreciate the work of those in similar fields.
