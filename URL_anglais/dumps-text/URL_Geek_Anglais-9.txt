                        Is the word "geek" good or bad?

   Posted by Joffles 2017-05-10T22:42:10Z

   Water Cooler

   This thread sparked an interesting discussion about the use of the word
   "geek." Do you feel that the word geek is a derogatory term? Do you
   embrace it?

   Personally, I don't particularly care. People can call me a geek, a
   nerd, a bearded sloth or Ultimate-Heart-Breaker-5000!

Is the word "geek" good or bad?

       If i had known about this shirt my kids would have worn it too.
       They may call me geek in a negative way and i'll ignore it because
       in the end those ignorant folks will come to me anyhow to fix their
       issues and then i can earn from them.

       I don't think "geek" has such a negative connotation now. I'm
       called a geek about the things I like all the time. To "geek" out
       just shows a high level of enthusiasm for something in my eyes.
       Also, quite a few of the richest people in the world like Mark
       Zuckerberg and Bill Gates are considered to be "geeks".

       If you have nerdy hobbies then embrace your inner dork!
       I'm glad those t-shirts that say geek on them are no longer
       considered fashionable. I hated seeing them about. Usually on
       people who you are fairly sure picked on geek-kind when they were
       at school.

       Geek -  geek (n.) "sideshow freak," 1916, U.S. carnival and circus
       slang, perhaps a variant of geck "a fool, dupe, simpleton" (1510s),
       apparently from Dutch gek or Low German geck, from an imitative
       verb found in North Sea Germanic and Scandinavian meaning "to
       croak, cackle," and also "to mock, cheat" (Dutch gekken, German
       gecken, Danish gjække, Swedish gäcka). The modern form and the
       popular use with reference to circus sideshow "wild men" is from
       1946, in William Lindsay Gresham's novel "Nightmare Alley" (made
       into a film in 1947 starring Tyrone Power)."An ordinary geek
       doesn't actually eat snakes, just bites off chunks of 'em, chicken
       heads and rats." [Arthur H. Lewis, "Carnival," 1970]
       Dork -  dork (n.) "stupid person," 1967, originally U.S. student
       slang, perhaps from earlier meaning "penis" (1964), itself probably
       an alteration of dick. Related: Dorky; dorkiness.

     I guess it's less of a mouthful than "I call Someone Else, Plug in a

     I'm left Clueless Squad" ;-)
       To be fair, everyone I worked with at ConnectPro (Canadian Geek
       Squad clone at their Future Shop brand) is now doing very well in
       IT despite having no formal education. I agree that some people in
       that position could be clueless but everyone I worked with was
       working up to something else. When you start getting laptops thrown
       at you in your office job I'll accept your criticisms of the Geek
       Squad.

       Don't get it. Seriously. Words on their own mean nothing.  It's
       words in context that are important.  As is the context.

       I was always the geeky / nerdy kid (they were interchangeable at my
       school... only the real geeks and nerds knew the difference). I
       still always take it as a compliment even when it wasn't meant as
       such. Proud to be a nerd (self-identified) or a geek :)

       I might have to start using "Ultimate-Heart-Breaker-5000" instead
       as Joffles suggests! Haha, but actually this is good to know, I
       agree the context is everything.

       I have no problem with it at all - at times I consider it a
       compliment.  Most geeks I know make a lot of money and are
       extremely intelligent, so it is not so bad to be a geek.  ;)
