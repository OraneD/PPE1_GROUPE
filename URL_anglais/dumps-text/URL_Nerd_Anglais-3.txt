A Historical Timeline of the word “Nerd”

   the stone age

   1929: The interjection “nerts”, possibly used because some consider it
   vulgar to blurt out “nuts”, comes into use and enjoys some popularity.

   1938: Ventriloquist Edgar Bergen (father of Candice) debuts a new dummy
   named Mortimer Snerd, which he plays as a slow-talking rural rube.

   1940s: The singular “nert” evolves into a label applied to people,
   meaning someone who is nutty. Its use is not widespread, but has been
   attested among particular groups, one being surfers.

   1950: Dr. Seuss tosses off the nonsense word “nerd” as the name of an
   imaginary animal in If I Ran The Zoo.

   the iron age

   1951: Teen slang in the Detroit area is reported to have adopted “nerd”
   as the fashionable new term for an uncool unhip person, otherwise known
   as a “drip” or “square”. This usage may or may not predate Dr. Seuss’s,
   and may or may not derive from “nert” or “Snerd”, but it definitely
   spread from southeast Michigan.

   1960: The spelling “nurd” comes into use, and predominates for some
   time. It spreads widely among many of the younger generation, from
   hot-rodders to Yale students, but remains relatively little known to
   most of the public.

   1965: The word is by now somewhat commonly connected with bookish
   intellectual types. At MIT the spelling “gnurd” catches on. At this
   time, brainiacs at MIT and similar institutions are known for backward
   clothing styles and outmoded crewcuts. Many of them enjoy trashy
   science fiction.

   1968: The “Save Star Trek” movement becomes the first instance of
   successful mass activism to promote an agenda favorable to nerds. The
   event fosters a lasting tendency for nerd culture to treat fandom as
   something to be proselytized.

   circa 1972: I hear the word for the first time when my dad (himself a
   high IQ pocket-protected engineer who had only recently ceased rocking
   a crewcut) declares Batman to be a nerd. It briefly becomes my little
   brother’s favorite new word.

   1974: ABC debuts Happy Days, which is set in the 1950s, and popularizes
   the term by using it as a piece of period slang. They usually apply it
   not to smart or socially awkward characters, but to those who try to be
   cool and fail. Usage of the word among viewers skyrockets.
   the golden age

   1975: As the first home microcomputers are announced, National Lampoon
   issues this poster, firmly establishing the stereotype for what the
   word will now mean.

   1977: In this watershed year, personal computers reach the mass market,
   which results in raising the visibility of computer and electronics
   experts as a recognizable social class, and over several years,
   accelerating the association of the word with them in particular. At
   the same time, Star Wars brings science fiction fandom into mainstream
   visibility, and a “New Wave” sound starts to emerge in rock&roll,
   coming from bands that are often overtly nerdy, in stark contrast to
   the previously popular “cock rock” style.

   1981: By now several computer innovators have achieved wealth and
   become household names, thereby becoming role models and getting people
   to start thinking of nerds as winners. This trend will expand steadily
   for the rest of the century. New Wave rock moves into the mainstream,
   making stars of nerds like David Byrne and Thomas Dolby.

   1984: The movie Revenge Of The Nerds is released. Some people with
   technical interests and skills immediately start to use the word as
   self-description, with a “nerd pride” movement becoming visible a few
   years later.

   1993: As nerd pride becomes fairly well established, and the mainstream
   connotation of the word slowly shifts from disdain to respect,
   Professor Gerald Sussman, a former MIT hacker, tells a reporter “I want
   every child to become a nerd.” (It’s around this time that one of my
   nerd friends took to proclaiming “It’s our world now and you can’t have
   it back!”)

   1995: The World Wide Web popularizes mass usage of computer networks.
   Non-experts start creating websites in large numbers, and produce the
   beginnings of today’s distinct internet culture. In this environment,
   minor subcultures become highly visible, and the terms “nerd” and
   “geek” are increasingly used for those seen devoting excessive time and
   energy to fandoms, similarly to how the word “otaku” is used in Japan —
   a term which anime fandom is bringing to America around this time.

   1996: The term “Geek Chic” appears, as high-fashion designers start to
   ape nerdy clothing styles for both sexes — even “flood” pants. Also,
   aintitcoolnews.com appears, and proves so influential that the
   entertainment industry soon begins recognizing nerd fans as both a
   powerful and well-organized interest group, and a lucrative audience
   demographic.

   2000: The bursting of the dot-com stock bubble marks an endpoint to the
   “computer revolution” — it’s now just big business, not the definition
   of success and coolness. This removes some of the excessive glamor that
   has built up around nerds.
   the plastic age

   2001: The first iPod appears. Trendy coolness in technology is now
   associated with entertainment rather than the business world.

   2003: San Diego Comic-Con grows with extreme rapidity, becoming the
   center of the various fandoms associated with nerds. The public becomes
   steadily more aware of the breadth of “nerd culture”. It becomes common
   for people to describe themselves as nerds or geeks based on their
   fandoms rather than on their skills or temperament — that is, they
   label themselves as such based on what they consume rather than what
   they produce, even as these fandoms increasingly merge into the
   mainstream. Opinion pieces bemoaning mass nerdification start cropping
   up, mainly in conservative media.

   2007: CBS debuts The Big Bang Theory, bringing the first broad
   depiction of all facets of nerd culture to a mass audience.

   2009: As the word “geek” increasingly pushes aside the word “nerd”,
   some nerd produces this handy diagram for defining the difference
   between them:

   2012: As supposedly nerdy interests such as superheroes and wizards
   take over pop culture, jock types also move into technical fields.
   “Brogrammers” are now a thing.

   2013: “Movie Bob” Chipman sums up where we’ve arrived by observing that
   calling oneself a nerd has now become merely a “commodified lifestyle
   label”, saying nothing about your temperament or skills or social
   history. He also notes that today’s gamers and comic geeks have become
   as prone to bullying as their jock predecessors were.

   2016: Director Paul Feig makes a Ghostbusters sequel with a new
   all-female team. The backlash from an offended minority eventually
   drives him to say, “Geek culture is home to some of the biggest
   assholes I’ve ever met in my life.” Meanwhile, in the fashion world,
   “geek chic” is more popular, and more literal, than ever.

   Nowadays I’d say the best spirit of true nerddom isn’t being carried
   forward by “nerds” anymore... where I now see it flourishing best is
   among the crowd known as MAKERS.
