Highly Intelligent But Socially Handicapped: The Psychology Of The Nerd

   Ask Dr. Dombeck
   Question:

     My son in his mid-30s, is extremely intelligent, has a Ph.D. in
     Chemistry, and is a postdoctoral researcher at an Ivy League
     University. He has significant social-relationship problems. He does
     not know many of the rules of social interaction, and lacks
     confidence in social situations. Some of his actions are often
     considered eccentric. He is interested in developing social
     relationships. But, he has had no significant romantic relationships
     with the opposite sex (though he has had a couple of brief ones). He
     does have male friends but none very close. He also has non-romantic
     relationships with the opposite sex (even more-so than with male
     friends). He has some minor eccentric behavioral mannerisms. His
     almost always carries a backpack with him, often to the most
     inappropriate places, his dress awareness is weak (by any
     convention), and he has developed other minor unusual mannerisms,
     which discourage potential female partners. He is, though, generally
     considerate, kind, and gentle, he is attractive though short in
     stature (about 5ft2”). He is well aware of his problem and makes an
     effort to deal with his situation (sometimes they are clumsy and
     sometimes with varying degrees of success). He is well liked and
     respected by some of his academic peers, and his research results
     are impressive but he is often not invited to participate in social
     events because he is seen to ‘not fit in’. He interacts well with
     his family and has a loving relationship with his parents and
     siblings. He lives away from home (near his university) and speaks
     often by phone and visits his family occasionally. He is not
     generally depressed (he has many professional successes and is quite
     respected), but his clumsy social skills and lack of romantic
     relationship do depress him. He is generally kind, rational, and
     forthcoming. He readily seeks advice from his close family. He is
     easily insulted in social situations when his is confused or reacts
     inappropriately. When in his element (chemistry, history, politics,
     or near his family) he is confident and imposing, and often humorous
     (he has a keen sense of humor). His main concern is that he will not
     succeed in finding a life-partner and will not raise a family (which
     he dearly wishes to do).

   Answer:

   The implicit question here is "what can be done to help my son?" The
   answer is, that I don’t know exactly, but we can explore some ideas
   about what might be wrong and what a helping process might look like.

   Before trying to address a problem it is generally best to first know
   what is the cause and nature of the problem. So, the first part of my
   response will be to offer you some ideas about what might be happening
   to your son. None of the ideas I’m going to explore here are necessary
   descriptive of your son, but they might help to organize our thinking.

   Your son is a member of a social class often described in colloquial
   terms as nerds. I mean no insult by using this term! I use it in the
   sense of the second of the Answers.Com definitions for the term:

     A person who is single-minded or accomplished in scientific or
     technical pursuits but is felt to be socially inept.

   Meant in this way, the term nerd has utility. It allows us to talk in
   general terms about a group of individual who have similar social
   awkwardness issues. Since I can’t think of a better term to use to
   describe such individuals, let’s talk about the psychology of the nerd.

   Nerdiness exists on a continuum. Some people are a little nerdy, while
   others are very nerdy. The more nerdy you get, the more you tend to be
   oblivious of yourself as a social object and to behave in socially
   awkward ways such as dressing badly or failing to take subtle hints.
   Nerdiness is developmental in some fashion. It tends to come on early
   on in life. People grow out of being nerds; they don’t become nerds in
   later life.

   Because nerds are awkward and un-smooth, they tend to be rejected and
   isolated by peers, and because it is emotionally painful to experience
   such marginalization, they tend to push themselves to be excellent in
   aspects of life that do not require social skills. If they are at all
   smart, they tend to go whole hog into some intellectual pursuit.
   Computer science is a big one for many nerds (or that subspecies of
   nerd who proudly call themselves "geek"), but any non-social
   intellectual pursuit will do. Chemistry fits the profile as would most
   any academic pursuit. The strategy at work is a variation on the theme
   of making a weakness into a virtue. Nerds can become very good at their
   chosen fields because they have very little to keep them from devoting
   all of their energy to those fields. These are not balanced people with
   rich social lives. Instead, these are people who spend holidays writing
   papers. I know this because I used to be one of these people.

   The big lie that a nerd tells him or herself is that they will make a
   satisfying life for themselves based purely on their intellectual
   pursuits. For some minority of nerds, this may be possible, but I think
   for many others, the "life of the mind" becomes excruciatingly lonely
   after a while. The problem is though that by the time such people
   realize that they are in trouble, they don’t know how to fix
   themselves. They are so very competent at what they do intellectually
   that they cannot stand the thought of having to go back to being an
   absolute beginner and trying to figure out how to be with other people.
   The whole idea of being an adult who is a virgin (or a relationship
   virgin anyway even if not a physical one) is deeply shameful and
   embarrassing and people tend to avoid dealing with what is deeply
   shameful and embarrassing. What happens is that they know there is a
   problem but when they try to deal with it, they get so painfully
   emotional and threatened that they become defensive and back off the
   project and retreat back to the ivory tower where they stay until the
   next time they get lonely. The other academicians around you sharing
   office space in the tower are by and large also nerds and also socially
   awkward and so they can’t help much. They are good for mutually
   reinforcing the idea of how great it is to work on the chosen field,
   but they aren’t good for intimacy. Too bad because intimacy is, for
   most people, ultimately what gives meaning to life.

   I don’t think anyone has developed a comprehensive theory of what
   causes people to become nerds, but any such theory will have to take
   the following concepts into account if it is ever written.

   Some people’s nerdiness is a function of a condition called Asperger’s
   Disorder which is a mild pervasive developmental disorder on the same
   spectrum as Autism. We’ve got a very comprehensive article about Autism
   and Aspergers available here, but the thing to know about this sort of
   condition is that it involves language and communication deficits which
   have a basis in neurological deficits. The prototypical person with
   Asperger’s learns language reasonably well, but doesn’t seem to
   experience language the same way as a normal person. Some quality of
   emotional transmission is missing. People with Asperger’s can talk in
   odd cadences and/or they may fail to understand social reciprocity such
   that they may manifest an "eccentric and one-sided social approach to
   others (e.g., pursuing a conversational topic regardless of others’
   reactions) rather than social and emotional indifference." (DSM page
   80). The character of Toby in the movie "American Splendor" is one
   reasonable portrayal.

   An alternative kind of nerd is someone who develops a condition known
   as Schizotypal Personality Disorder. To say someone has a personality
   disorder in general is to say that they have grown up with some
   important part of the normal human coping toolkit missing or
   undeveloped. People with personality disorders are developmentally
   delayed in important social-emotional ways that cause them to be "one
   trick ponies" who can only react to the world in a narrow and rigid set
   of ways. When such a person is in their element, all is fine (because
   they know how to cope with their element), but when they go out of
   their element, they lack the flexibility to know how to cope
   appropriately and experience significant problems as a result (or for
   some personality disorders, other people experience significant
   problems).

   Schizotypal Personality Disorder is defined in the DSM (page 701) as
   characterized by, "A pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal
   deficits marked by acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for,
   close relationships, as well as by cognitive or perceptual distortions
   and eccentricities of behavior…". The definition of eccentric behavior
   typically characteristic of Schizotypal PD is beyond simple
   cluelessness about how to dress. It involves the presence of minor
   sorts of delusional beliefs (such as a belief in UFOs or ESP), odd
   perceptions and sensations, odd mannerisms and speech patterns, and
   mild paranoia. Recall the character of Kramer from the television show
   "Seinfeld" and you’ll have a good idea of what this looks like. People
   with Schizotypal PD are thought of as eccentric, weird, strange, or
   different. People tolerate them and may find them amusing but always
   tend to consider them an outsider.

   Having a diagnosable disorder such as Asperger’s or Schizotypal PD
   might qualify a person as a nerd or a geek in some circles, but the
   reverse is not true. There are many nerds who don’t qualify for any
   diagnosable disorder. They may be the way they are for other reasons.
   One primary reason that could push a person towards nerdiness is the
   presence of simple but profound social anxiety. Social skills are
   learned through interaction with other children and adults during
   childhood and adolescence. If you are a very anxious child and avoid
   developmentally important social interactions, you will tend to remain
   delayed in your social-emotional skillfulness. If, because of your
   social anxiety you cease to push yourself to interact and instead
   channel your energy into socially avoidant pursuits the problem becomes
   compounded. Not being a member of intimate relationships means you are
   cut off from important feedback such as how to dress appropriately or
   when it is not good form to wear a backpack. The true nerd will
   rationalize his or her odd social behavior, I think for defensive
   purposes. It is simply very painful to admit to yourself that you are
   essentially incompetent in this very important aspect of life.

   The really important question is what can be done to turn this sort of
   ship around. In order for your son to become more able to realize his
   dreams he will need to get through his avoidance and confront his
   social deficits. He will need to learn how people actually perceive him
   (and he will need to remain able to care about this perception so as to
   be motivated to do something about it). He will need to alter his
   lifestyle so as to make a commitment towards putting himself out there
   in the world with regard to eligible women partners. He will need to
   become less inwardly focused and to learn how to see himself as the
   social object he is. This is going to be painful work. He is likely to
   feel very vulnerable while engaged in this work and perhaps at times
   quite pathetic. In order to best help him make his way through this
   painful learning process and ultimately through the universally awkward
   and painful dating process it may benefit him to have a guide in the
   form of a psychotherapist or other high quality "life coach" with whom
   he can form a trusting relationship, who can give him the social
   feedback he needs, and who can be a stable and comforting force in his
   life as he makes awkward mistakes.  This will need to be a long term
   process I think as the learning that needs to take place is basic and
   the avoidance of this learning is deeply ingrained. To the extent that
   your son’s problems are caused by an actual diagnosable disorder such
   as Asperger’s or Schizotypal, the same goals might apply, but the goals
   to shoot for should be more circumscribed and more modest, and the
   coach figure should an actual licensed therapist experienced in working
   with individuals with the disorder in question.
