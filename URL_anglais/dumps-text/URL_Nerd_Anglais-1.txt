   My friends always use "nerd" to describe an intelligent person, but
   when I searched its meaning online, I found that it's not really a good
   word.

   "A foolish or contemptible person who lacks social skills or is
   boringly studious."
   [Oxford Dictionaries]

   I've become so confused with this word.
   Is it an insult or a compliment?

       How much research have you done? Nerd has another meaning.

       So who are you going to believe? The dictionary, or your friends?
       (are they native speakers, btw?). But you should have noted the
       second definition from the same source: a single-minded expert in a
       particular technical field (i.e. - a geek). Personally, I don't
       think that particularly implies "intelligent", but perhaps that's
       the way your friends understand the associations.

     * Context and intent are both important here; "nerd" can be an
       insult, a compliment or somewhat "neutral".

   If they are referring to an "intelligent" person like you say then they
   most probably mean:

     a person who is extremely interested in one subject, especially
     computers, and knows a lot of facts about it — Cambridge Dictionary

   Example,

     I'm a real grammar nerd.

   So, no it is not in the bad or negative sense but you still have to be
   careful with this word some people might find a bit offensive to be
   called a "nerd" especially when this word has a first definition that
   is kind of negative.

       It used to be more offensive than it has become. Nowadays it
       borders on being a compliment, in the right context.

       This is one of those terms that is generally positive when applied
       to oneself, but probably isn't safe to apply to others without
       careful qualification. For example, "You like sitting up late at
       night debating the merits of descriptivism? You're my kind of
       nerd!" would be OK, but "You're such a nerd!" without any
       additional context might (still) be taken as something of an
       insult.

     * This may be local to my area/social circles, but oftentimes "nerd"
       is used as a term of endearment used with your closer friends. E.g.
       Saying "What's going on, nerds?" when greeting a group of friends.
       I personally haven't heard it used negatively since I watched
       Revenge of the Nerds in middle school (early 2000s).

       @Pants: that's almost certainly local to your area, because to my
       ears (as a self-confessed nerd on many topics), it sounds really
       weird to refer to your friends collectively as "nerds" in the
       example you gave.

   Nowadays it can be good or bad. In the past it was inherently bad, but
   it has undergone the phenomenon of reappropriation, which causes
   insults to become a "badge of honour" for the insulted group.

   In my personal experience, nerd was an insult most (~ 90%) of the time
   until the mid-late 2000s, when the concept of a "nerd culture" became
   surprisingly popular. Of course, nerd as "person who follows nerd
   culture" and nerd as "person who studies too much" do not always
   overlap.

   I don't agree nerd is restricted to intelligent.

   A nerd can use the n word to describe themselves but other people
   should not.

   A nerd can say he is a nerd pack like me.

   As a non nerd there are so many ways to express without using the n
   word. He/she is into computing. He is a car racing enthusiast. All she
   can talk about is medicine.

   He is cryptography nerd from MIT that works for the NSA is OK.

   It clearly does not have the strict negative connotation of the other n
   word. Just making a silly comparison.

   In some language communities, "nerd" is a loaded word; for example,
   when used to describe a boy or man, nerd can carry connotations of
   being easy to push around and/or sexually frustrated. In some language
   communities, it's basically considered inoffensive; but unless you want
   to risk offending the other person, I don't think this a good term. And
   I think that, when speaking to men especially, it's safer to assume
   that the other person considers themselves "dominant" (not like a
   bully; more like, someone you don't f**k with), so best to choose
   language that doesn't convey a disconnect between how you're viewing
   the other person and how they view themselves. This applies w/o much
   qualification when talking to women, too; if you're talking to a woman,
   for example, keep in mind that she may well be elected in as a
   parliamentary MP one day, or become the CEO of a major corporation, or
   end up owning a large and highly successful business, etc. Such a woman
   may not appreciate being called a "nerd", I think.

   A nerd is someone with a drive to study. The driver can exist for any
   of a bunch of different reasons. There are also different areas of
   focus. Eventually, though, a nerd, in order to be a nerd, must have a
   certain "love of the subject".

   And then there are shy nerds, who will cringe upon hearing the word,
   and less shy nerds, who will openly affirm, part of their identity, as
   a nerd.

   For a reference and idea, please see the movie T.G.I.F by Katy Perry,
   which might be able to give you some ideas about why one would be, or
   want to be, or end up being, a nerd.

       insult or a compliment.

     * Add I said obj the comments below the original post, it is not a
       matter to be known by the person issuing the word. It's all about
       how the taker takes it.
