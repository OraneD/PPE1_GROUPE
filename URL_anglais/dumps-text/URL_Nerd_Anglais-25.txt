Hey David Price, 'Nerd' Is Not An Insult

   October 10, 2013
   (BUTTON)

   This article is more than 9 years old.

   The Red Sox have beaten the Tampa Bay Rays. But before we move onto our
   next opponent, let's take a moment to reflect on an unfortunate episode
   from last weekend.

   After losing Saturday's American League Division Series game to the
   Sox, Tampa Bay pitcher David Price said something he shouldn't have. He
   used the "N" word.

   No, not that one.

   A different, much less offensive expletive beginning with the 14th
   letter in the alphabet.

     [Price] touched  a nerve that runs through American culture like a
     fault line: nerds on one side, jocks on the other.

   Nerd!

   First, confronting the press just after his team's loss at Fenway Park,
   Price smugly retorted, "Sweet questions, nerds."

   The insinuation: You never played the game, George McFly and Mr. Spock.
   You clearly know nothing about baseball. You're not qualified to pass
   judgment on my game.

   Then, later that night, Price dug himself even deeper. Following the
   post-game analysis he'd seen on TV, Price hurled another fastball
   insult at TBS commentators Dirk Hayhurst and Tom Verducci, via Twitter
   (in a since deleted tweet):

     Dirk Hayhurst...COULDNT hack it...Tom Verducci wasn't even a water
     boy in high school...but yet they can still bash a player...SAVE IT
     NERDS

     -- David Price (@DavidPrice14), Oct. 6, 2013

   Classy.

   Off the bat, there are a couple of teachable moments here.

   Price's rant was sent on Sunday at 1:07 a.m. Tweeting past midnight is
   never a good idea. Also not recommended: athletes watching analyses of
   their performances after they've played poorly.

   Later that day, Price tried to take it back:

     Last night got out of hand and I apologize for the things that I
     said on here...if I offended you I am very sorry for doing
     so...#thatsnotme

     — David Price (@DAVIDprice14) October 6, 2013

   Save it, Price.

   I mean, for one thing, get your facts straight.

   Verducci is a far cry from "water boy"; in addition to being a TBS
   commentator and long-time writer for "Sport Illustrated," he was
   actually a walk-on baseball player at Penn State.

   And, for his part, Hayhurst is a former MLB pitcher. Granted, his stats
   weren't exactly stellar (0-2 win-loss record, lifetime). But being a
   less-storied player than Price doesn't render his qualifications as a
   critic null and void. His line-crossing offense, apparently, was going
   on to become an author, and then a commentator. By Price's logic, it
   seems Hayhurst had become too intellectual in his post-play years.
   Verducci is also bookish: He a co-authored a tome with former Yankees
   skipper Joe Torre called "The Yankee Years."

   Price's reaction was regrettable. And while his apology tweet sought to
   downplay his intent, in dissing these two analysts, he touched a nerve
   that runs through American culture like a fault line: nerds on one
   side, jocks on the other.

   If you thought you left this clique-based social strata warfare behind
   in high school, think again.

   It's an issue that David Anderegg tackles in his book "Nerds: How
   Dorks, Dweebs, Techies, and Trekkies Can Save America and Why They
   Might Be Our Last Hope." Computer geeks, writers and "thinker"-types
   have always been at war against those who find glory on the playing or
   battlefield. In Anderegg's estimation, the conflict boils down to an
   epic battle in American history between “Men of Action” and “Men of
   Reflection,” one that has roots going back to "The Legend of Sleepy
   Hollow" and its protagonist Ichabod Crane, the John Quincy Adams vs.
   Andrew Jackson presidential race, Superman and the Fonz.

     If you thought you left this clique-based social strata warfare
     behind in high school, think again.

   As a result, we're torn. We say we want our kids to excel in school,
   sure. But we are highly suspicious — even hostile — towards the
   intellectual and the thoughtful. Not surprising, we're still falling
   behind other nations in reading, math and science achievement.

   Our conflicting attitude isn't surprising coming from a country that
   feels, well, dumber than rest of the countries on the playground. A
   little muscle-flexing, a little bullying, makes sense.

   Price's attack on Verducci and Hayhurst may have been thoughtless and
   knee-jerk. He probably hates having his performance dissected by
   anyone. Who wouldn't?

   But in a weird way, he has every right to be threatened. The
   statistic-memorizing-number-crunchers likely do know more about
   baseball than he does. This is the age of "Moneyball" and sabermetrics
   (using empirical analysis to build better baseball teams) after all.
   Thanks to geeks, teams have discovered that something more tangible
   than gut or instinct wins pennants: stats.

   Unfortunately, despite how someone like Price feels about nerds,
   there’s no denying it: they're winning. See: Steve Jobs, Bills Gates,
   Paul Allen, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, and Sergey Brin.

   I mean, the mere fact that Price is using Twitter to communicate with
   his fans proves the dweebs triumphed: they stole the beer, the stash,
   and the prom queen and moved the entire party to Jack Dorsey’s
   penthouse apartment in San Francisco.

   Rather than turning it into a jocks vs. nerds showdown, then lamely
   apologizing, "Last night got out of hand," Price could have offered a
   different olive branch. He could have manned up, and admitted how he
   felt.

   Perhaps, in the moment after the loss, and after facing the wrath of
   the nerdy press, staring at him behind their horn-rimmed glasses, slide
   rulers tucked in their pocket protectors, he could have said, "Guys,
   I'm feeling a little ... uh ... [gulp] ... vulnerable right now.
   Please, no more questions." That would have been an honorable, and
   brave, admission.

   Of course, in another twist, it turns out Dirk Hayhurst is a nerd,
   after all!

   "I was just a poor moisture farmer in the Dagobah system living
   underneath my foster parent's staircase," he says on his website's bio,
   "until an owl delivered to me a letter telling me I was invited to play
   baseball at a school infested with Force wielding vampires in Forks,
   Washington."

   There's even a picture of him posing with "Star Wars" characters.

   Nerd! Exposed!

   I've saved the best irony for last.

   When Hayhurst's memoir "Out of My League: A Rookie's Survival in the
   Bigs" was published, a famous sports figure weighed in with the glowing
   endorsement, "A must read!"

   The blurber's name? David Price.
