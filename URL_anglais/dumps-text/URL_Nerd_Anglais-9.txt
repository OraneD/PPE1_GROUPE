No, Nerds Are Not Today’s Cool - by a self-proclaimed nerd

   “Nerds are the New Cool” but have things really changed for those that
   are bullied by others?

   The last few years have seen everything from comic book superheroes to
   Dungeons & Dragons in the spotlight. While the media has celebrated and
   flashed headlines like “Nerds have taken over,” “Why Nerds are
   Popular,” and “Nerds are the new cool.”

   Gone are the days of nerds being cast as pathetic losers. Modern-day
   nerds are portrayed as smart, passionate, respectful, and financially
   successful. But for all the positive changes, are today’s nerds truly
   accepted as cool?

What is a Nerd?

   Nerd is a relatively new word. Its earliest publication was by Dr.
   Seuss in 1950 as a nonsensical word. In If I Ran the Zoo, the main
   character, Gerald McGrew wants to find new bizarre to add to his
   fantasy zoo:
   [q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0394800818&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPla
   ce=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=adventures2au-20&language=en_US]

   “And then, just to show them, I’ll sail to Ka-Troo

   And Bring Back an It-Kutch, a Preep, and a Proo,

   A Nerkle, a Nerd, and a Seersucker too!”

   The following year, the word started to take on its more well-known
   connotation when Newsweek published an article discussing the slang
   Detroit youth:

   “someone who once would be called a drip or a square is now,
   regrettably, a nerd, or in a less severe case, a scurve.”

   By the 1970s, the concept of the uncool nerd was fully engrained in our
   culture. In the popular TV series Happy Days, the gullible and clumsy
   character of Potsie was often called a nerd. He was portrayed as the
   opposite to the motorcycle riding, leather-jacketed, and ultimately
   cool Fonzie.

   Ten years later, the modern stereotypical nerd was solidified in our
   culture. Nerds were physically weak, lacking all sense of style,
   unattractive, and often wore glasses. They were book smart but lacked
   any street smarts. Unable to develop romantic relationships, they were
   seen as lonely losers that had few friends and were seen as societal
   outcasts.

The Changing Face of Nerds

   The boom of Silicon Valley in the 1990s changed the way that nerds were
   seen in the media. Previous outcasts were cast into the spotlight as
   Bill Gates, Larry Page, Steve Jobs, and others became huge successes.

   The 1990s was a boon to fantasy and science fiction as well, both
   classically considered prime nerd territory. Harry Potter was released
   in 1997, and 1999 saw the release of the first new Star Wars movie in
   20 years and the first film in the Matrix trilogy.

   A few years later, Tolkien became mainstream with Peter Jackson’s Lord
   of the Rings in 2001. And former comic books found huge successes with
   Iron Man in 2008 and Man of Steel in 2013.

   It seems that it is no longer considered a bad thing to be a nerd in
   recent times. T-shirts and clothing proudly proclaim their wearer as
   “Nerd” and “Geek.” There was the rise of new media like Slashdot, which
   advertised as “News for Nerds.” Shows like The IT Crowd and The Big
   Bang Theory have been huge successes. Even a new Spanish holiday was
   created on May 25th - Nerd Pride Day (on the anniversary date of the
   release of Star Wars, A New Hope.) And Dungeon and Dragons, once the
   embodiment of nerdom, had its best year ever in 2020.

“I think that nerds, if you want to call them that, have only gotten hipper
and more assimilated into the culture.”

   Modern-day nerds are represented as someone that is highly intelligent,
   interesting, respectful, and very successful. They are still seen as
   socially awkward but typically in a positive, lovable way. Nerds are
   seen as passionate about their hobbies and take pride in labeling
   themselves as “nerds.” People self-label themselves as book nerd, food
   nerd, gaming nerd, science nerd, etc., and are seen as those that
   passionately embrace their subjects.

Has it Really Changed?

   The Oxford Dictionary is considered to be one of the most authoritative
   definitions of the English language. But as of 2021, their definition
   of nerd has not changed much and is not overly positive.

   Noun:
    1. A foolish or contemptible person who lacks social skills or is
       boringly studious
    2. A single-minded expert in a particular technical field.

   Intransitive Verb:
    1. Engage in or discuss a technical field obsessively or with great
       attention to detail
       1.1 Be or become extremely excited or enthusiastic about a subject,
       typically one of specialist or minority interest.

   For all the progress, nerds are still seen by many as losers. Students
   that are smart, shy, or socially inept are still the target of
   harassment by their peers. The word “nerd” is still thrown as an
   insult, along with dweeb, dork, geek, loser, and a host of other names
   used by school bullies. Nerds are still seen at the bottom of most
   school clique hierarchies and are treated by many as outcasts.

Nerds and Bullying

   Whether through physical, verbal, or online harassment or through
   social exclusion, nerds have been the target of bullying by others for
   decades.

   Many modern celebrities that enjoy nerd hobbies will attest to the
   pains of being bullied as children. For example:

   Many successful celebrities that enjoy typical nerd hobbies such as
   comics, DnD, and video games, will attest to the pains of being bullied
   as children.

   And while it can be claimed that these incidents were based on the
   older stereotypes seen in the 80s and 90s, the rates of bullying are
   still high. In the US, one out of five students reports being bullied.
   And up to 65% of bullying is not reported to officials. Another report
   from 2019 claimed that over half the students surveyed stated that they
   had been bullied in the last 30 days.

   The most likely targets with victims of school bullying tending to have
   the following characteristics:

   • Successful academically

   • Creative

   • Introverted

   • Isolated

   • Differentiating physical appearance,

   • Have hobbies, interests, or values different than their peers

   Based on the previous stereotypes, it definitely seems that these
   victims are the nerds of today.

   And for many, that bullying does not end in the classroom. A 2021 WBI
   study on bullying in the workplace found that 30% of Americans are
   bullied at work. And up to 43% of remote workers report being similarly
   harassed.

   The recent pandemic has also seen a rise in bullying against nerds. The
   politicization of science has turned many people against those that
   have a more academic or scholarly background. From news reports to
   neighbors, nerds are often targeted.

   And one of the most ironic forms of bullying by other nerds. There are
   corners of almost every fandom where people have a nerdier-than-thou
   attitude. Newbies and those that lack the time or interest to delve
   deeply into the subject are criticized for not being nerdy enough.
   Ironically, often by those that were themselves bullied for their deep
   interest in the first place.

   Women, in particular, are vulnerable to insults. The concept of “fake
   nerds” and that women are only pretending to be nerdy in order to get
   attention. It is a sad irony that those girls who have a genuine
   interest in a nerdy hobby are being made to feel like outsiders within
   pursuits traditionally embraced by those that themselves felt like
   outsiders.

The Future of Nerds

   While many aspects of nerd culture have become more acceptable and
   mainstream, nerds are not yet fully accepted in our society. Far too
   often, we are still met with insults, bullying, and the term is seen as
   negative by many in society.

   Being a nerd is not just about playing DnD or video games. It’s not
   just about reading fantasy books or being good with computers. Being a
   nerd is about feeling like an outsider and wanting a place to belong.

   We need to continue to support each other and stand up for those that
   are bullied or harassed. Embrace those that want to be part our hobbies
   and remind others that there is a wide world of acceptance out there.

   I want the day where being a nerd is truly awesome. We have made great
   progress, but we still have a long way to go.

     Gibert : “ I just wanted to say that I'm a nerd, and I'm here
     tonight to stand up for the rights of other nerds. I mean uh, all
     our lives we've been laughed at and made to feel inferior. And
     tonight, those bastards, they trashed our house. Why? Cause we're
     smart? Cause we look different? Well, we're not. I'm a nerd, and uh,
     I'm pretty proud of it.”

     Lewis : “Hi, Gilbert. I'm a nerd too. I just found that out tonight.
     We have news for the beautiful people. There's a lot more of us than
     there are of you. I know there's alumni here tonight. When you went
     to Adams you might've been called a spazz, or a dork, or a geek. Any
     of you that have ever felt stepped on, left out, picked on, put
     down, whether you think you're a nerd or not, why don't you just
     come down here and join us. Okay? Come on.”

     Gibert : “Just join us cause uh, no-one's gonna really be free until
     nerd persecution ends.”
