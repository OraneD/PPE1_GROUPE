                   Pros & Cons of Being a Geek While Studying

   Pros & Cons of Being a Geek While Studying

   Geeks are often referred to as individuals who are socially inept with
   weird interests, which they are overly obsessed with. As much as this
   cannot be ruled to be a pure stereotype, there is actually the good
   side of being a nerd as there is the downside, which usually is
   exaggerated. Geeks are mostly interested in tech and awkwardly
   fascinating stuff undesirable to their peers.

   They are less related to romantic lifestyles unless they are dating
   their fellow nerds who share common interests. Free essay samples on
   love is a common prescription when they desire to transition from
   platonic to romantic relationships. Nerds try to find the best essay
   about love so as to serve as a guide in a field in which they are
   deficient of expertise and experience.

An Insight into the Lifestyle of Geek Students

   Living a nerdy lifestyle has its ups and downs, especially while in
   school. At times, it will play to your advantage while other times it
   spins around and places you at a disadvantage. Whichever way it turns
   out, nerds always find a way to embrace the situation and be
   themselves. Here is a highlight of the advantages and disadvantages of
   being a nerd while in school.

Pros:

   A cool nerd takes advantage of their geeky nature to turn things to
   their favor in the following ways.

1. Use studying as an excuse to disconnect from the world

   Statistically, most geeks are introverts. They dislike crowds and
   partaking in social activities. To lock out friends or shun such
   activities, they bury themselves deep in books of disciplines that
   interest them. Although this is seen as a weird behavior, it aids in
   sharpening their academic edge, hence their knowledgeable nature.

2. Keeps them off drugs

   High schools and colleges constitute the largest markets for drug
   peddlers. Students with loads of time on their hands usually find
   themselves being trapped by these vices. For nerds, online games and
   books act as a shield to drug abuse. Their lifestyle leaves practically
   no time to indulge in such behaviors.

   Furthermore, even if they were to, who would they do it with?

3. Enhances comprehension of complex ideas

   Geeks are perceived as geniuses because of their vast multidisciplinary
   comprehension of issues. Ever wondered why your nerdy friend always has
   an accurate answer to most of the questions or at least a reasonable
   explanation? It’s because they spend a significant amount of their time
   reading and writing on topics and issues that fascinate them.

4. Makes one more desirable to the opposite sex

   A study conducted in an American college found students who were
   labeled nerds to be more desirable to students of the opposite gender
   than their average counterparts. This desire was motivated by their
   mysterious lifestyle and the undivided attention they give to their
   favorite interests.

Cons:

   Did you know that sometimes, bookworms wish they were teenagers who
   enjoyed life the normal way without feeling so much pressure? Just
   sometimes. This is not to say that they are abnormal, but let’s see
   what makes it difficult for them.

1. They are often victims of stereotypes

   Students are comfortable being around people of similar interests and
   likes. Once one deviates from their way of life and portrays an unusual
   lifestyle, they likely to be branded according to their character.
   Nerds who stay away from relationships and girls are likely to be
   thought to be weirdos or gay, even when they are nothing close to the
   closet.

2. Nerds are devoid of social and communication skills

   The introvert nature of nerds limits the development of their social
   and communication skills. Some of them have been said to be great
   writers who produce quality essays that are used as examples to the
   class.

   What happens to oral communication though? Their verbal skills leave a
   lot to be desired. No way can one develop their verbal communication
   skills when they do not talk to people often.

3. More likely to suffer from depression

   Depression is not selective and can affect just about anyone. It is
   worse when it affects nerds. To begin with, it may go unnoticed and
   undiagnosed since their lifestyle mimics that of a normally depressed
   person.

   Secondly, their circle of friends is small, and they may lack someone
   to share their thoughts and problems with. Professional therapy
   services from a psychologist come in handy for them.

Parting Shot

   Nerds are super intelligent; they live independently, irrespective of
   the other students’ lifestyles. Even in classwork, you won’t find them
   scrabbling for the free samples of essays online. They come up with a
   unique piece inspired by their vast knowledge.

   Being geeky is being unique.
