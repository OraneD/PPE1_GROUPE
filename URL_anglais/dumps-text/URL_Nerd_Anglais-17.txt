Revenge of the Nerds: Being Popular in High School Doesn't Make You Rich,
After All

   Last year, a study found that extra friends in high school translated
   into extra pay in middle age. But new research says otherwise.

   Mathletes, goth freaks, drama nerds: you've been vindicated.

   Last year, awkward teens everywhere got a rather depressing dose of
   news when new research suggested that kids who were popular in high
   school also tended to end up richer than their classmates later in
   life. "Economics Says Revenge of the Nerds Is a Lie," declared our
   friends at The Atlantic Wire. "Sorry nerds: popular kids earn more in
   the long run," mocked Wonkblog.

   As a registered high school nerd -- and I used to compete in both chess
   and Magic the Gatheringâ„¢ tournaments, meaning I'm actually registered
   somewhere -- this study naturally bugged the hell out of me. So I
   couldn't help but feel a little glee upon discovering that Jason
   Fletcher, a professor at Yale's School of Public Health who has studied
   the way teenage depression and ADHD impact future earnings, had
   released a draft paper this week suggesting that, no, being well-liked
   in 12th grade does not in fact make you wealthier in middle age.

   There were already a few reasons to take last year's study with a grain
   of salt. To begin, the paper used data on men who graduated from
   Wisconsin high schools in 1957. During a telephone interview in 1975,
   the subjects were asked to name their three best male friends from
   senior year. So we're talking about a paper that hinged on the
   quarter-century-old recollections of middle-aged, mostly white guys who
   grew up in the Eisenhower era.

   But hey, good studies that track their subjects over decades are hard
   to come by, and academics work with the data they have. The research
   team counted up how many times each of their Wisconsin men was
   "nominated" as somebody's best bud, then looked at their pay decades
   later. And, as noted, the popular kids tended to make out best. Each
   nomination was worth roughly a 2 percent earnings increase 35 years on,
   equivalent to nearly half the boost that comes from finishing an extra
   year of school. "We estimate that moving from the 20th to 80th
   percentile of the high-school popularity distribution yields a 10
   percent wage premium nearly 40 years later," the paper noted. In the
   end, the authors suggested that the social skills required to make a
   friends at age 18 might simply have been useful in the adult workplace.
   Not inconceivable, but certainly discouraging for those who had trouble
   finding a lunch table.

   Enter Fletcher. Instead of looking at Silent Generation men from the
   Midwest, he pulled data from a 13-year study that began tracking
   thousands of male and female adolescents from across the country in
   1994. The survey asked students to name up to ten friends instead of
   three, which gave a somewhat more complete set of data to work with.

   It turned out there were similarities between the findings. Just like
   the Wisconsin study, each friendship nomination translated into 2
   percent higher wages come age 30. But here was the big difference: the
   new data set not only allowed Fletcher to compare the effects of
   popularity between peers over time, but also between thousands of
   siblings. Social scientists like to compare siblings when possible,
   because by tracking people from the exact same family background, it
   lets them to try figure out what other factors might be influencing
   their life trajectories. And in this case, it led to an interesting
   result. Even if one sibling was better liked at school, they weren't
   any more likely to out-earn their brother or sister. The impact of
   popularity on future pay simply vanished.

   Fletcher argued that this was a sign that the real driving force behind
   income among the study's subjects was probably family background, not
   your ability to make friends as an adolescent.

   Now a few quick but crucial notes about both these studies. Headlines
   aside, neither of them is actually measuring popularity in the Mean
   Girls sense of the word. Rather, they're really measuring if students
   are well liked, whether they're the most popular girl on the
   cheerleading squad, the starting quarterback, or the nicest geek on
   model U.N. Moreover, the papers don't appear completely incompatible:
   the Wisconsin, study, for instance found "a positive association
   between a warm early family environment" and popularity in high school.
   So a caring family translated into friends at school which translated
   into a payday at work. That seems at least somewhat in keeping with
   Fletcher's new paper, which simply does more to control for the effects
   of how students were raised.

   But in any event, it seems there's hope, if not revenge, for us nerds
   yet.
