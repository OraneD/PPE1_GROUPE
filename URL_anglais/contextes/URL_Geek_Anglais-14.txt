   Are you a geek or a nerd? Maybe you don’t want to admit it, but chances
   are you may have some qualities of both in you. But what is the real
   difference between the two terms?
     __________________________________________________________________

   ‘Geek’ comes to us from history, being a term coined all the way back
   in the 1500s. At that time, it was reserved for a person thought to be
   a fool. Another possibility is that it comes from the 18th-century word

   chickens.

   Fast-forward to the 1950s and the word geek came to mean what it
   essentially does today, designating someone who is very passionately
   into technology or certain sub-cultures. You can have academic geeks,
   computer geeks, film geeks, Star Wars geeks, video game geeks, food and
   fashion geeks and so forth. Geeks gather collections of objects, facts,
   and mementos related to their obsessive interests, as Big Think wrote
   previously. Geeks can also fix things for you, a fact used by the
   retailer Best Buy in naming its repair division the Geek Squad.

   A ‘nerd’ could be similarly passionate but focused on achievement over

   Here’s how Slackpropagation differentiates between geeks and nerds:

     “Both are dedicated to their subjects, and sometimes socially
     awkward. The distinction is that geeks are fans of their subjects,
     and nerds are practitioners of them.”

   While geeks can have certain cool factors, nerds tend to be thought of
   as overly intellectual and often perceived to be lacking in social
   graces. As a result, more people would admit to being geeks than nerds.
   Still, like geeks, modern nerds have reclaimed some measure of pride in
   what was once a more decidedly negative term with the nerds of Silicon
   Valley, in particular, finding that the qualities that once had some

   Think contributor, explains how the terms have been reappropriated. She
   explains that ‘nerd’ refers to someone with a depth of knowledge in a
   specific field or topic—making her a true word nerd—while geek now
   denotes a technical know-how, a brainy group that is good at
   technology.

   It also bears saying that one of the most popular shows of the past
   decade has been The Big Bang Theory, which celebrates both nerds and
   geeks. This is a clear example of Slackpropagation’s definition: The
   Big Bang Theory is a show about nerds, made for geeks. The show makes
   gentle fun of its heroes, who fit most of the stereotypes ascribed to
   these words, but it also helps them become understandable and beloved

   Also of note is that you will now find more people calling themselves
   nerds or geeks than ever before, signifying the cultural transformation
   of these concepts. Many people are now ready to “own their nerd-dom,”
   as noted by author Neil Gaiman.

   So which one are you, a geek or a nerd?
