   When I enter a room of my peers I always go "Wassup nerds?"
   The irony is that in fact, I am the nerd.
   I don't use geek because that is a stupid word.

   I donâ€™t really like the words but Iâ€™d say they have different meanings.
   In my brain a nerd is someone whoâ€™s very academic and studies a lot
   where are a geek is someone whoâ€™s really into something very specific
   such as films, then that would make them a film geek. Donâ€™t know if

   draw a Venn Diagram ( how nerdy is that ? :teehee: )
   the geek circle and nerd circle intersect. however there are geeks who
   are not nerds and vice-versa. geekiness implies some level of physical
   manifestation of weirdness... typically protruding teeth & thick
   glasses; the key feature of nerds is intellectual obsessiveness.
   both geeks & nerds are definitely non-chadian.

   I say Nerd more.
   They both mean the same thing to me, just that Geek sounds a bit more
   offensive - hence why i use Nerd.

   I use nerd more. Both are terrible descriptions for basically anything
   but I sometimes throw out nerd as a semi-ironic descriptor. Geek as a
   word is just horrible sounding and has no place in the English language
   frankly.

   I never use those words because I see them as insults. The only context
   I ever use them in is when I talk about how people thought I was a nerd
   as a child and made fun of me for it, even though I was not a nerd in
   the first place.

   I don't use them. And they're different.
   Geeks are more into like comics and stuff.
   While nerds are academically smart.
   I mean someone could be both.
