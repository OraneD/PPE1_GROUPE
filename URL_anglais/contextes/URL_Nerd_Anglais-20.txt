9 Tips on Befriending a Nerd

   Nerds are truly treasures to friendships and to society. But why do we
   see less nerds mingling with regular people? Thatâ€™s because we think
   they do, but they donâ€™t. We often mistake nerds with geeks. Thereâ€™s a
   fine line between the both. Geeks love sci-fi, fantasy and all kinds of
   fictional, but they arenâ€™t always studious. Nerds on the other hand
   loves fictional superheroes and related entertainment too, but their
   first priority is academics. Their intense passion for education is
--
   information and to learn new things.

   Befriending a nerd is not easy, but itâ€™s not impossible as well. Here
   are tips on how to make nerdy friends in no time.

1. Be open for knowledge

   Itâ€™s important for a nerd to have a friend who has opinions more or
   less similar to them. Knowledge is fuel, so if you want to make a nerd
   friend, you must always be on the lookout for information and knowledge
   about their specialty area. For an instance, a nerdy Chemical Engineer
   would love to have an info-rich conversation with someone whoâ€™d have
   knowledge in that particular field. This is quite tricky if youâ€™re not
   a nerd and nowhere close to understanding the science behind
   thermodynamics and energy balance. But hey! Thereâ€™s other tips you can
   focus onâ€¦

2. Donâ€™t take time for granted

   Nerds are not always so grumpy and serious like Big Bang portrayed
   Sheldon. There are quite a lot of cool fellows who really want to have
   fun. Nerds may interpret fun differently than to us. While fun to us
   means forgetting about work and deadlines, for a nerd, it could mean
   learning something different to their usual scope. It could either be
   fictional or entertainment â€“ if thereâ€™s knowledge to be grasped, a nerd
   wouldnâ€™t hesitate. Time means a lot to them, so if youâ€™re befriending a
   nerd make sure the fun topics you bring to the table are informative at
   the same time.

3. Be a bit reserve

   This could work both ways. A needy nerd would like a super extrovert to
   make life interesting, but most nerds keep themselves occupied and love
   the solitude. Socializing for them is kryptonite. So until you figure
   out which type of nerd youâ€™re trying to befriend, try to act reserved
   at first. Itâ€™s like approaching a deer. Too much flair might scare them
   off. So be tactical and give them the space to feel comfortable around
   you. Baby steps are much required when associating a nerd.

4. Build a fondness for board games

   Video games are quite the trend now, but a nerd finds true
   entertainment in intellectual board games and competitive opponents. If
   youâ€™re already good at it, then kudos! But if youâ€™re not, take some
   time to learn board games. By board games, we not only mean chess. It
   could be Dungeons & Dragons for all we know, nerds do have similarly
   different likings. They might not like Monopoly, but if theyâ€™re up for
   some fun, you could probably get them to play this intensifying

5. Show how quirky you are

   If youâ€™re a jock, nerds would hate you. Itâ€™s nothing personal nor
   grudges. Many just dislike the idea of mingling with overly famous and
   perfect peeps. Even if youâ€™re an average person your confidence and
--
   perfect nor pretend to be, neither are them. Show your quirky side and
   theyâ€™ll accept you for who you are. Thatâ€™s pretty much the first step
   in clicking in to a nerd gang.

6. Donâ€™t smart-shame them

   One thing nerds hate about regular people is that their intelligence is
   always brought up in conversations as mockery. Theyâ€™re already quirky
   and anxious, why make them more tensed by putting them in the spotlight

7. Level up your humour

   A great way to bond with a nerd is either through knowledge or humour.
   Although they are bad at cracking quality jokes. They thoroughly enjoy
   being in the company of those who do. Avoid dry jokes and dirty jokes
   (to a certain extent), many nerds donâ€™t find them thrilling. Especially
   if youâ€™re of the opposite sex, you may have to hold back some of those
   visually disturbing jokes. Come up with a witty sense of humour.

8. Attend a Comic-con

   Comic-cons are sprawling with geeks who love fiction, but nerds can
   also be spotted. Hereâ€™s a tip on how you can scan through properly to
   differentiate the nerds from the crowds of geeks. Cos-play is mostly a
   geekâ€™s activity, however some nerds do wear costumes too but they
   arenâ€™t concerned of grabbing the spotlight like the geeks do. If you
   see groups of friends either in costumes or not, keeping to themselves,
   thatâ€™s a nerd bunch worth your attention.

9. Take their advice

   This tip is not just a way of befriending a nerd, but rather a benefit
   of it. Nerds are quite intelligent. Although they rarely speak out loud
   of their opinions, their advices are quite bright. You just need to dig
   deep into mine those golden thoughts. A great way to build a friendship
   with a nerd, is by admiring them for their unique thinking method. Ask
   for life advices from them, theyâ€™d be more than happy to assist you,
   and by far, nerd advices havenâ€™t lead any of us anywhere near danger.

Conclusion

   So there you go! Making a nerd friend is not so difficult after all.
   Just be super slow with the approach and make your presence comfortable
   for them to be around. Once you make a nerd friend, thatâ€™s a friend for
   life. Good luck!
