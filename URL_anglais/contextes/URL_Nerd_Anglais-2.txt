   Being a nerd is pretty cool.

   Even Mark Zuckerberg agrees, encouraging girls to*be* the nerd rather
   than just date them.

   But if you’re already a nerd, than that’s no news to you. Long have you
   been talking about the new Star Wars and despairing at the long wait
   for the new A Song of Ice and Fire book.

   Yeah. Basically.

   All that panic aside, there are a lot of reasons why being a nerd is
   just the best.

   Here are just 13 of them.

   (If you’re not sure how nerdy you are, we have a quiz for that.)

1) You probably have a higher than average IQ
--
2) You have a large variety of interests

   Sci-fi, fantasy, games – the nerd universe has no shortage of niches
   you can geek out to.

--
   socialise with.

   Thousands of nerds literally attend these things. Thousands.

5) And even when on your own…you’re never alone

   If there’s one place you know your fellow nerds will be, it’s the
   internet. There’s nothing more fun than giggling together over anime
   memes.

   From Bill Gates to Mark Zuckerberg himself, nerds have been powerful
   movers and shakers in this world.

   No matter how many insults were thrown your way and or how many of your
   Yu-Gi-Oh cards were hidden though, your nerdy ways were never going to
   change.

   Nerds will happily spend hours trying to work their way through a level
   in a game or untangle huge amounts of complicated code.

13) You’re very friendly and accepting… of everyone

   Being weird is a fundamental part of being a nerd, so you’re very
   accepting everyone’s odd little ticks.

   We’re just one big nerdy family really.
