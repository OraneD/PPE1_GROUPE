The Majority of Americans Believe that “Geek” is A Compliment

Lies Damned Lies
--

     Two-thirds (66 percent) of Millennials (respondents aged 18-34)
     think being identified as a “geek” is a compliment, while only 39
     percent of respondents aged 65 and older agree. The cultural shift
     in the way Americans perceive geeks is further evidenced by the
     findings that eight out of 10 (82 percent) respondents feel it is
     more acceptable to be a geek today than it was 15 years ago.

   Other interesting findings of the survey include that the target of the
   word “geek” is most frequently considered to be extremely intelligent,
   a good source for advice about technology, and is frequently a person
   with the latest gadgets. But if you really want some fodder for your
   arguments about geeks in the mainstream, note this: 41% percent of
   ORC’s respondents said they’d rather be a geek than a jock, compared to
   22% preferring otherwise.

   Now that we’ve reclaimed “geek” however, there are still some issues to
   be ironed out. “Nerd,” for example, is apparently still derogative. 87%
   of self-identified geeks would rather be called a “geek” than a “nerd.”
   Oh, and 50% of the respondents still equate geekdom with being socially
   awkward. While I won’t deny my own social awkwardness, but maybe it’s
   something we can all agree to work on?

   Oh! And happy Geek Pride Day!
