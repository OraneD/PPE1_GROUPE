                        Is the word "geek" good or bad?

   This thread sparked an interesting discussion about the use of the word
   "geek." Do you feel that the word geek is a derogatory term? Do you
   embrace it?

   Personally, I don't particularly care. People can call me a geek, a
   nerd, a bearded sloth or Ultimate-Heart-Breaker-5000!

Is the word "geek" good or bad?

       depends on the context and the person saying it..
       fellow geek? .. yeah .. no problem.
       someone who doesn't have a clue? .. no.. boot-to-the-head

       If i had known about this shirt my kids would have worn it too.
       They may call me geek in a negative way and i'll ignore it because
       in the end those ignorant folks will come to me anyhow to fix their
       issues and then i can earn from them.

       If geek is the most deragatory thing people call you that's not too
       bad.

       I've been called much, much worse than Geek in this life, that one
       I don't particularly care about one way or the other.

       I did score some points in a meeting once when I said "It's ok,
       we're all geeks here."  Or was it nerds?

       I don't think "geek" has such a negative connotation now. I'm
       called a geek about the things I like all the time. To "geek" out
       just shows a high level of enthusiasm for something in my eyes.
       Also, quite a few of the richest people in the world like Mark
       Zuckerberg and Bill Gates are considered to be "geeks".

       If you have nerdy hobbies then embrace your inner dork!
       I'm glad those t-shirts that say geek on them are no longer
       considered fashionable. I hated seeing them about. Usually on
       people who you are fairly sure picked on geek-kind when they were
       at school.

       quickly so I have no problem with it.

       I'm a bit of a geek and a nerd.
       Here's a handy unofficial reference guide to Geek/Nerd
       classification.

       I know non-geeky/nerdy autistics. It's a cruel stereotype

       For me, it's all about how it's used, so context is important.
       Overall, I don't find it insulting at all. Proud to be a geek.

       Most geeks have great paying jobs and stability. Being a geek isn't
       all that bad nowadays.

       I rarely ever hear the word geek these days! More often than not
       it's "nerd", which I don't really think has a negative intent.

       Geek -  geek (n.) "sideshow freak," 1916, U.S. carnival and circus
       slang, perhaps a variant of geck "a fool, dupe, simpleton" (1510s),
       apparently from Dutch gek or Low German geck, from an imitative

       popular use with reference to circus sideshow "wild men" is from
       1946, in William Lindsay Gresham's novel "Nightmare Alley" (made
       into a film in 1947 starring Tyrone Power)."An ordinary geek
       doesn't actually eat snakes, just bites off chunks of 'em, chicken
       heads and rats." [Arthur H. Lewis, "Carnival," 1970]

       To be fair, everyone I worked with at ConnectPro (Canadian Geek
       Squad clone at their Future Shop brand) is now doing very well in
       IT despite having no formal education. I agree that some people in
       that position could be clueless but everyone I worked with was
       working up to something else. When you start getting laptops thrown
       at you in your office job I'll accept your criticisms of the Geek
       Squad.

       I was always the geeky / nerdy kid (they were interchangeable at my
       school... only the real geeks and nerds knew the difference). I
       still always take it as a compliment even when it wasn't meant as
       such. Proud to be a nerd (self-identified) or a geek :)

       It doesn't bother me at all. In fact, lots of things I identify
       with the word "Geek" in them... Geeks Who Drink, ThinkGeek, band
       geek, "Freaks & Geeks" :) Image:

       I have no problem with it at all - at times I consider it a
       compliment.  Most geeks I know make a lot of money and are
       extremely intelligent, so it is not so bad to be a geek.  ;)
