The History of Women in Geek Culture Should Not Be Overlooked

   video “Nothing to Prove.”

   There is a strange and pervasive cultural myth that geek girls are like
   unicorns—we’re rare and mythical creatures who can’t possibly be real.
   This anxiety over gender is deeply tied to nerds’ concerns about the
   mainstreaming of geekdom.

   Combative male gatekeepers to geekdom—from comic book store employees
   to Magic: The Gathering judges to Comic Con panelists to video game
   developers—have a history of marginalizing, challenging, and harassing
   perceived interlopers. The (mostly) straight, white, male people police
   geek culture using concepts like “geek cred” (having an impossibly
   detailed knowledge of a fandom’s minutia), claims that girls are
   thin-skinned princesses who can’t handle the culture, and implications
   that female nerds are either only tagging along with their boyfriends
   or trying to sleep their way to success. A few years ago, the idea
   spread that “Fake Geek Girls” are only latching on to current trends in
   popular culture to be seen as cool.

   What’s ironic about all this is that while television, film, video

   male audiences—across media, female creators and storylines with women
   at their center are the exception to the rule—women make up at least
   half of people who spend money on geeky media and events.

   For example, take gaming. While many video games exhibit rampant

   video games are still seen as the domain of teen boys.

   One place where geeky people actually turn up IRL and confound notions
   of what nerds look like is at conventions. This past year, website The
   Nerdist declared that “Women Totally Dominated This Year’s San Diego

   pass-buyer, and knowing that the number of respondents likely
   represents but a small segment of Emerald City’s 70,000 attendees, we
   can’t necessarily assume that there were in fact, more geek girls than
   fanboys at the con, only that women might be more likely to take
   surveys. As The Mary Sue rightly noted, “All that this graphic might
   mean is that the folks who actually care enough about ECCC to want to
   help make it better were majority women.” That might be true—women
   certainly have more incentive to give feedback on how to make geek
   spaces more inclusive.

   All this shows that women are not only geeky—we’re invested in geekdom.
   It’s part of our identity and millions of women are working to make
   that culture better. At the fourth annual GeekGirlCon ’14 in October,
   over 7,000 Trekkies, Trekkers, Jedi Knights, Twi-hards, Bronies,
   Whovians, Browncoats, Steampunks, Sherlockians, X-Philes, Saltgunners,
   Scoobies, Potterheads, and even some Muggles turned out to an event
   that explicitly says “no ‘geek cred’ is required” to be part of the
   celebration, or the community.

   To get another picture of the huge part women play in geekdom, look at
   the results of fan-ticketing service Eventbrite’s recent online survey
   of 2,600 convention ticket-buyers. The gender split of fans was nearly

   demographic of older members who seemed out of touch with the interests
   and concerns of younger geek communities. She noted that while the
   programming organizers at Worldcon made conscientious efforts to
   embrace diversity, “older fans who came up through pre-Internet fandom…

   welcome and safe, distributing badges with preferred gender pronouns
   and making their code of conduct visible. Additionally, Nine Worlds has
   a robust Geek Feminism track that includes panels on feminist geek
   activism, geeky crafting as a political act, sex work in the works of
   Joss Whedon, and ways to get more women into creative industry job
   positions.

   Newer cons ensure continued success by embracing a wide array of
   geekery and fandoms that to cater to emerging, youthful, geek audiences
   through mission-based tone, mood, and environment.

   As geek culture evolves, and women become more visible members of the
   community, it’s tempting to assume that geek girls’ surging numbers are
   simply the result of the mainstreaming of geekdom. But fangirls have
   been around just as long as fanboys, playing Pac-Man, contributing to
   and editing fan magazines, writing fan fiction, vidding, and
   cosplaying.

   Long before GeekGirlCon or Nine Worlds, girl geeks were organizers of
   early fan gatherings, fan-based initiatives, alternative media-making,
   and indie publishing opportunities. Bjo Trimble spearheaded a letter
--
   underground comix movement. WisCon, the first and foremost feminist
   science fiction convention in the world, held its inaugural con in 1977
   and will be convening their 39^th event in 2015. Some of these geeky
   foremothers were honored at Geek Girl Con this year: Seattle-based
   radio producer Jamala Henderson organized and moderated a panel on Geek
   Elders, introducing audience members to four women involved in 1970s
   and 80s Star Trek and Star Wars fan communities. Women have been
   integral to building geek communities—history that should not be
   forgotten or overlooked.
